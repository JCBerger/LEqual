\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(1) Following the 2018 and 2020 elections, there was a significant lack of confidence in Georgia election systems, with many electors concerned about allegati
ons of rampant voter suppression and many electors concerned about allegations of rampant voter fraud;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(2) Many Georgia election processes were challenged in court, including the subjective signature-matching requirements, by Georgians on all sides of the polit
ical spectrum before and after the 2020 general election;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(3) The stress of the 2020 elections, with a dramatic increase in absentee-by-mail ballots and pandemic restrictions, demonstrated where there were opportunit
ies to update existing processes to reduce the burden on election officials and boost voter confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(4) The changes made in this legislation in 2021 are designed to address the lack of elector confidence in the election system on all sides of the political s
pectrum, to reduce the burden on election officials, and to streamline the process of conducting elections in Georgia by promoting uniformity in voting. Several examples will help explain how these goals are achieved;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(5) The broad discretion allowed to local officials for advance voting dates and hours led to significant variations across the state in total number of hours
 of advance voting, depending on the county. More than 100 counties have never offered voting on Sunday and many counties offered only a single day of weekend voting. Requiring two Saturday voting days and two optional Sunday voting days will dramaticall
y increase the total voting hours for voters across the State of Georgia, and all electors in Georgia will have access to multiple opportunities to vote in person on the weekend for the first time;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(6) Some counties in 2020 received significant infusions of grant funding for election operations, while other counties received no such funds. Promoting unif
ormity in the distribution of funds to election operations will boost voter confidence and ensure that there is no political advantage conferred by preferring certain counties over others in the distribution of funds;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(7) Elections in Georgia are administered by counties, but that can lead to problems for voters in counties with dysfunctional election systems. Counties with
 long-term problems of lines, problems with processing of absentee ballots, and other challenges in administration need accountability, but state officials are limited in what they are able to do to address those problems. Ensuring there is a mechanism t
o address local election problems will promote voter confidence and meet the goal of uniformity;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(8) Elections are a public process and public participation is encouraged by all involved, but the enthusiasm of some outside groups in sending multiple absen
tee ballot applications in 2020, often with incorrectly filled-in voter information, led to significant confusion by electors. Clarifying the rules regarding absentee ballot applications will build elector confidence while not sacrificing the opportuniti
es for electors to participate in the process;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(9) The lengthy absentee ballot process also led to elector confusion, including electors who were told they had already voted when they arrived to vote in pe
rson. Creating a definite period of absentee voting will assist electors in understanding the election process while also ensuring that opportunities to vote are not diminished, especially when many absentee ballots issued in the last few days before the
 election were not successfully voted or were returned late;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(10) Opportunities for delivering absentee ballots to a drop box were first created by the State Election Board as a pandemic response. The drop boxes created
 by rule no longer existed in Georgia law when the emergency rules that created them expired. The General Assembly considered a variety of options and constructed a system that allows the use of drop boxes, while also ensuring the security of the system 
and providing options in emergency situations;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(11) The lengthy nine-week runoffs in 2020 were exhausting for candidates, donors, and electors. By adding ranked choice voting for military and overseas vote
rs, the run-off period can be shortened to a more manageable period for all involved, easing the burden on election officials and on electors;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(12) Counting absentee ballots in 2020 took an incredibly long time in some counties. Creating processes for early processing and scanning of absentee ballots
 will promote elector confidence by ensuring that results are reported quickly;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(13) The sanctity of the precinct was also brought into sharp focus in 2020, with many groups approaching electors while they waited in line. Protecting elect
ors from improper interference, political pressure, or intimidation while waiting in line to vote is of paramount importance to protecting the election system and ensuring elector confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(14) Ballot duplication for provisional ballots and other purposes places a heavy burden on election officials. The number of duplicated ballots has continued
 to rise dramatically from 2016 through 2020. Reducing the number of duplicated ballots will significantly reduce the burden on election officials and creating bipartisan panels to conduct duplication will promote elector confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(15) Electors voting out of precinct add to the burden on election officials and lines for other electors because of the length of time it takes to process a 
provisional ballot in a precinct. Electors should be directed to the correct precinct on election day to ensure that they are able to vote in all elections for which they are eligible;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(16) In considering the changes in 2021, the General Assembly heard hours of testimony from electors, election officials, and attorneys involved in voting. Th
e General Assembly made significant modifications through the legislative process as it weighed the various interests involved, including adding further weekend voting, changing parameters for out-of-precinct voting, and adding transparency for ballot im

\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(1) Following the 2018 and 2020 elections, there was a significant lack of confidence in Georgia election systems, with many electors concerned about allegati
ons of rampant voter suppression and many electors concerned about allegations of rampant voter fraud;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(2) Many Georgia election processes were challenged in court, including the subjective signature-matching requirements, by Georgians on all sides of the polit
ical spectrum before and after the 2020 general election;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(3) The stress of the 2020 elections, with a dramatic increase in absentee-by-mail ballots and pandemic restrictions, demonstrated where there were opportunit
ies to update existing processes to reduce the burden on election officials and boost voter confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(4) The changes made in this legislation in 2021 are designed to address the lack of elector confidence in the election system on all sides of the political s
pectrum, to reduce the burden on election officials, and to streamline the process of conducting elections in Georgia by promoting uniformity in voting. Several examples will help explain how these goals are achieved;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(5) The broad discretion allowed to local officials for advance voting dates and hours led to significant variations across the state in total number of hours
 of advance voting, depending on the county. More than 100 counties have never offered voting on Sunday and many counties offered only a single day of weekend voting. Requiring two Saturday voting days and two optional Sunday voting days will dramaticall
y increase the total voting hours for voters across the State of Georgia, and all electors in Georgia will have access to multiple opportunities to vote in person on the weekend for the first time;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(6) Some counties in 2020 received significant infusions of grant funding for election operations, while other counties received no such funds. Promoting unif
ormity in the distribution of funds to election operations will boost voter confidence and ensure that there is no political advantage conferred by preferring certain counties over others in the distribution of funds;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(7) Elections in Georgia are administered by counties, but that can lead to problems for voters in counties with dysfunctional election systems. Counties with
 long-term problems of lines, problems with processing of absentee ballots, and other challenges in administration need accountability, but state officials are limited in what they are able to do to address those problems. Ensuring there is a mechanism t
o address local election problems will promote voter confidence and meet the goal of uniformity;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(8) Elections are a public process and public participation is encouraged by all involved, but the enthusiasm of some outside groups in sending multiple absen
tee ballot applications in 2020, often with incorrectly filled-in voter information, led to significant confusion by electors. Clarifying the rules regarding absentee ballot applications will build elector confidence while not sacrificing the opportuniti
es for electors to participate in the process;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(9) The lengthy absentee ballot process also led to elector confusion, including electors who were told they had already voted when they arrived to vote in pe
rson. Creating a definite period of absentee voting will assist electors in understanding the election process while also ensuring that opportunities to vote are not diminished, especially when many absentee ballots issued in the last few days before the
 election were not successfully voted or were returned late;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(10) Opportunities for delivering absentee ballots to a drop box were first created by the State Election Board as a pandemic response. The drop boxes created
 by rule no longer existed in Georgia law when the emergency rules that created them expired. The General Assembly considered a variety of options and constructed a system that allows the use of drop boxes, while also ensuring the security of the system 
and providing options in emergency situations;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(11) The lengthy nine-week runoffs in 2020 were exhausting for candidates, donors, and electors. By adding ranked choice voting for military and overseas vote
rs, the run-off period can be shortened to a more manageable period for all involved, easing the burden on election officials and on electors;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(12) Counting absentee ballots in 2020 took an incredibly long time in some counties. Creating processes for early processing and scanning of absentee ballots
 will promote elector confidence by ensuring that results are reported quickly;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(13) The sanctity of the precinct was also brought into sharp focus in 2020, with many groups approaching electors while they waited in line. Protecting elect
ors from improper interference, political pressure, or intimidation while waiting in line to vote is of paramount importance to protecting the election system and ensuring elector confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(14) Ballot duplication for provisional ballots and other purposes places a heavy burden on election officials. The number of duplicated ballots has continued
 to rise dramatically from 2016 through 2020. Reducing the number of duplicated ballots will significantly reduce the burden on election officials and creating bipartisan panels to conduct duplication will promote elector confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(15) Electors voting out of precinct add to the burden on election officials and lines for other electors because of the length of time it takes to process a 
provisional ballot in a precinct. Electors should be directed to the correct precinct on election day to ensure that they are able to vote in all elections for which they are eligible;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(16) In considering the changes in 2021, the General Assembly heard hours of testimony from electors, election officials, and attorneys involved in voting. Th
e General Assembly made significant modifications through the legislative process as it weighed the various interests involved, including adding further weekend voting, changing parameters for out-of-precinct voting, and adding transparency for ballot im
ages; and
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(17) While each of the changes in this legislation in 2021 stands alone and is severable under Code Section 1-1-3, the changes in total reflect the General As

\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(2) Many Georgia election processes were challenged in court, including the subjective signature-matching requirements, by Georgians on all sides of the polit
ical spectrum before and after the 2020 general election;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(3) The stress of the 2020 elections, with a dramatic increase in absentee-by-mail ballots and pandemic restrictions, demonstrated where there were opportunit
ies to update existing processes to reduce the burden on election officials and boost voter confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(4) The changes made in this legislation in 2021 are designed to address the lack of elector confidence in the election system on all sides of the political s
pectrum, to reduce the burden on election officials, and to streamline the process of conducting elections in Georgia by promoting uniformity in voting. Several examples will help explain how these goals are achieved;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(5) The broad discretion allowed to local officials for advance voting dates and hours led to significant variations across the state in total number of hours
 of advance voting, depending on the county. More than 100 counties have never offered voting on Sunday and many counties offered only a single day of weekend voting. Requiring two Saturday voting days and two optional Sunday voting days will dramaticall
y increase the total voting hours for voters across the State of Georgia, and all electors in Georgia will have access to multiple opportunities to vote in person on the weekend for the first time;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(6) Some counties in 2020 received significant infusions of grant funding for election operations, while other counties received no such funds. Promoting unif
ormity in the distribution of funds to election operations will boost voter confidence and ensure that there is no political advantage conferred by preferring certain counties over others in the distribution of funds;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(7) Elections in Georgia are administered by counties, but that can lead to problems for voters in counties with dysfunctional election systems. Counties with
 long-term problems of lines, problems with processing of absentee ballots, and other challenges in administration need accountability, but state officials are limited in what they are able to do to address those problems. Ensuring there is a mechanism t
o address local election problems will promote voter confidence and meet the goal of uniformity;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(8) Elections are a public process and public participation is encouraged by all involved, but the enthusiasm of some outside groups in sending multiple absen
tee ballot applications in 2020, often with incorrectly filled-in voter information, led to significant confusion by electors. Clarifying the rules regarding absentee ballot applications will build elector confidence while not sacrificing the opportuniti
es for electors to participate in the process;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(9) The lengthy absentee ballot process also led to elector confusion, including electors who were told they had already voted when they arrived to vote in pe
rson. Creating a definite period of absentee voting will assist electors in understanding the election process while also ensuring that opportunities to vote are not diminished, especially when many absentee ballots issued in the last few days before the
 election were not successfully voted or were returned late;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(10) Opportunities for delivering absentee ballots to a drop box were first created by the State Election Board as a pandemic response. The drop boxes created
 by rule no longer existed in Georgia law when the emergency rules that created them expired. The General Assembly considered a variety of options and constructed a system that allows the use of drop boxes, while also ensuring the security of the system 
and providing options in emergency situations;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(11) The lengthy nine-week runoffs in 2020 were exhausting for candidates, donors, and electors. By adding ranked choice voting for military and overseas vote
rs, the run-off period can be shortened to a more manageable period for all involved, easing the burden on election officials and on electors;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(12) Counting absentee ballots in 2020 took an incredibly long time in some counties. Creating processes for early processing and scanning of absentee ballots
 will promote elector confidence by ensuring that results are reported quickly;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(13) The sanctity of the precinct was also brought into sharp focus in 2020, with many groups approaching electors while they waited in line. Protecting elect
ors from improper interference, political pressure, or intimidation while waiting in line to vote is of paramount importance to protecting the election system and ensuring elector confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(14) Ballot duplication for provisional ballots and other purposes places a heavy burden on election officials. The number of duplicated ballots has continued
 to rise dramatically from 2016 through 2020. Reducing the number of duplicated ballots will significantly reduce the burden on election officials and creating bipartisan panels to conduct duplication will promote elector confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(15) Electors voting out of precinct add to the burden on election officials and lines for other electors because of the length of time it takes to process a 
provisional ballot in a precinct. Electors should be directed to the correct precinct on election day to ensure that they are able to vote in all elections for which they are eligible;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(16) In considering the changes in 2021, the General Assembly heard hours of testimony from electors, election officials, and attorneys involved in voting. Th
e General Assembly made significant modifications through the legislative process as it weighed the various interests involved, including adding further weekend voting, changing parameters for out-of-precinct voting, and adding transparency for ballot im
ages; and

\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(2) Many Georgia election processes were challenged in court, including the subjective signature-matching requirements, by Georgians on all sides of the polit

\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(3) The stress of the 2020 elections, with a dramatic increase in absentee-by-mail ballots and pandemic restrictions, demonstrated where there were opportunit
ies to update existing processes to reduce the burden on election officials and boost voter confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(4) The changes made in this legislation in 2021 are designed to address the lack of elector confidence in the election system on all sides of the political s
pectrum, to reduce the burden on election officials, and to streamline the process of conducting elections in Georgia by promoting uniformity in voting. Several examples will help explain how these goals are achieved;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(5) The broad discretion allowed to local officials for advance voting dates and hours led to significant variations across the state in total number of hours
 of advance voting, depending on the county. More than 100 counties have never offered voting on Sunday and many counties offered only a single day of weekend voting. Requiring two Saturday voting days and two optional Sunday voting days will dramaticall
y increase the total voting hours for voters across the State of Georgia, and all electors in Georgia will have access to multiple opportunities to vote in person on the weekend for the first time;

ons of rampant voter suppression and many electors concerned about allegations of rampant voter fraud;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(2) Many Georgia election processes were challenged in court, including the subjective signature-matching requirements, by Georgians on all sides of the polit
ical spectrum before and after the 2020 general election;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(3) The stress of the 2020 elections, with a dramatic increase in absentee-by-mail ballots and pandemic restrictions, demonstrated where there were opportunit
ies to update existing processes to reduce the burden on election officials and boost voter confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(4) The changes made in this legislation in 2021 are designed to address the lack of elector confidence in the election system on all sides of the political s
pectrum, to reduce the burden on election officials, and to streamline the process of conducting elections in Georgia by promoting uniformity in voting. Several examples will help explain how these goals are achieved;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(5) The broad discretion allowed to local officials for advance voting dates and hours led to significant variations across the state in total number of hours
 of advance voting, depending on the county. More than 100 counties have never offered voting on Sunday and many counties offered only a single day of weekend voting. Requiring two Saturday voting days and two optional Sunday voting days will dramaticall
y increase the total voting hours for voters across the State of Georgia, and all electors in Georgia will have access to multiple opportunities to vote in person on the weekend for the first time;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(6) Some counties in 2020 received significant infusions of grant funding for election operations, while other counties received no such funds. Promoting unif
ormity in the distribution of funds to election operations will boost voter confidence and ensure that there is no political advantage conferred by preferring certain counties over others in the distribution of funds;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(7) Elections in Georgia are administered by counties, but that can lead to problems for voters in counties with dysfunctional election systems. Counties with
 long-term problems of lines, problems with processing of absentee ballots, and other challenges in administration need accountability, but state officials are limited in what they are able to do to address those problems. Ensuring there is a mechanism t
o address local election problems will promote voter confidence and meet the goal of uniformity;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(8) Elections are a public process and public participation is encouraged by all involved, but the enthusiasm of some outside groups in sending multiple absen
tee ballot applications in 2020, often with incorrectly filled-in voter information, led to significant confusion by electors. Clarifying the rules regarding absentee ballot applications will build elector confidence while not sacrificing the opportuniti
es for electors to participate in the process;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(9) The lengthy absentee ballot process also led to elector confusion, including electors who were told they had already voted when they arrived to vote in pe
rson. Creating a definite period of absentee voting will assist electors in understanding the election process while also ensuring that opportunities to vote are not diminished, especially when many absentee ballots issued in the last few days before the
 election were not successfully voted or were returned late;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(10) Opportunities for delivering absentee ballots to a drop box were first created by the State Election Board as a pandemic response. The drop boxes created
 by rule no longer existed in Georgia law when the emergency rules that created them expired. The General Assembly considered a variety of options and constructed a system that allows the use of drop boxes, while also ensuring the security of the system 
and providing options in emergency situations;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(11) The lengthy nine-week runoffs in 2020 were exhausting for candidates, donors, and electors. By adding ranked choice voting for military and overseas vote
rs, the run-off period can be shortened to a more manageable period for all involved, easing the burden on election officials and on electors;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(12) Counting absentee ballots in 2020 took an incredibly long time in some counties. Creating processes for early processing and scanning of absentee ballots

\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(1) Following the 2018 and 2020 elections, there was a significant lack of confidence in Georgia election systems, with many electors concerned about allegati
ons of rampant voter suppression and many electors concerned about allegations of rampant voter fraud;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(2) Many Georgia election processes were challenged in court, including the subjective signature-matching requirements, by Georgians on all sides of the polit
ical spectrum before and after the 2020 general election;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(3) The stress of the 2020 elections, with a dramatic increase in absentee-by-mail ballots and pandemic restrictions, demonstrated where there were opportunit
ies to update existing processes to reduce the burden on election officials and boost voter confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(4) The changes made in this legislation in 2021 are designed to address the lack of elector confidence in the election system on all sides of the political s
pectrum, to reduce the burden on election officials, and to streamline the process of conducting elections in Georgia by promoting uniformity in voting. Several examples will help explain how these goals are achieved;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(5) The broad discretion allowed to local officials for advance voting dates and hours led to significant variations across the state in total number of hours
 of advance voting, depending on the county. More than 100 counties have never offered voting on Sunday and many counties offered only a single day of weekend voting. Requiring two Saturday voting days and two optional Sunday voting days will dramaticall
y increase the total voting hours for voters across the State of Georgia, and all electors in Georgia will have access to multiple opportunities to vote in person on the weekend for the first time;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(6) Some counties in 2020 received significant infusions of grant funding for election operations, while other counties received no such funds. Promoting unif
ormity in the distribution of funds to election operations will boost voter confidence and ensure that there is no political advantage conferred by preferring certain counties over others in the distribution of funds;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(7) Elections in Georgia are administered by counties, but that can lead to problems for voters in counties with dysfunctional election systems. Counties with
 long-term problems of lines, problems with processing of absentee ballots, and other challenges in administration need accountability, but state officials are limited in what they are able to do to address those problems. Ensuring there is a mechanism t
o address local election problems will promote voter confidence and meet the goal of uniformity;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(8) Elections are a public process and public participation is encouraged by all involved, but the enthusiasm of some outside groups in sending multiple absen
tee ballot applications in 2020, often with incorrectly filled-in voter information, led to significant confusion by electors. Clarifying the rules regarding absentee ballot applications will build elector confidence while not sacrificing the opportuniti
es for electors to participate in the process;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(9) The lengthy absentee ballot process also led to elector confusion, including electors who were told they had already voted when they arrived to vote in pe
rson. Creating a definite period of absentee voting will assist electors in understanding the election process while also ensuring that opportunities to vote are not diminished, especially when many absentee ballots issued in the last few days before the
 election were not successfully voted or were returned late;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(10) Opportunities for delivering absentee ballots to a drop box were first created by the State Election Board as a pandemic response. The drop boxes created
 by rule no longer existed in Georgia law when the emergency rules that created them expired. The General Assembly considered a variety of options and constructed a system that allows the use of drop boxes, while also ensuring the security of the system 
and providing options in emergency situations;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(11) The lengthy nine-week runoffs in 2020 were exhausting for candidates, donors, and electors. By adding ranked choice voting for military and overseas vote
rs, the run-off period can be shortened to a more manageable period for all involved, easing the burden on election officials and on electors;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(12) Counting absentee ballots in 2020 took an incredibly long time in some counties. Creating processes for early processing and scanning of absentee ballots
 will promote elector confidence by ensuring that results are reported quickly;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(13) The sanctity of the precinct was also brought into sharp focus in 2020, with many groups approaching electors while they waited in line. Protecting elect
ors from improper interference, political pressure, or intimidation while waiting in line to vote is of paramount importance to protecting the election system and ensuring elector confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(14) Ballot duplication for provisional ballots and other purposes places a heavy burden on election officials. The number of duplicated ballots has continued
 to rise dramatically from 2016 through 2020. Reducing the number of duplicated ballots will significantly reduce the burden on election officials and creating bipartisan panels to conduct duplication will promote elector confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(15) Electors voting out of precinct add to the burden on election officials and lines for other electors because of the length of time it takes to process a 
provisional ballot in a precinct. Electors should be directed to the correct precinct on election day to ensure that they are able to vote in all elections for which they are eligible;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(16) In considering the changes in 2021, the General Assembly heard hours of testimony from electors, election officials, and attorneys involved in voting. Th
e General Assembly made significant modifications through the legislative process as it weighed the various interests involved, including adding further weekend voting, changing parameters for out-of-precinct voting, and adding transparency for ballot im
ages; and
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(17) While each of the changes in this legislation in 2021 stands alone and is severable under Code Section 1-1-3, the changes in total reflect the General As
sembly\'92s considered judgment on the changes required to Georgia\'92s election system to make it \'91easy to vote and hard to cheat,\'92 applying the lessons learned from conducting an election in the 2020 pandemic.\'94

\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(1) Following the 2018 and 2020 elections, there was a significant lack of confidence in Georgia election systems, with many electors concerned about allegati
ons of rampant voter suppression and many electors concerned about allegations of rampant voter fraud;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(2) Many Georgia election processes were challenged in court, including the subjective signature-matching requirements, by Georgians on all sides of the polit
ical spectrum before and after the 2020 general election;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(3) The stress of the 2020 elections, with a dramatic increase in absentee-by-mail ballots and pandemic restrictions, demonstrated where there were opportunit
ies to update existing processes to reduce the burden on election officials and boost voter confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(4) The changes made in this legislation in 2021 are designed to address the lack of elector confidence in the election system on all sides of the political s
pectrum, to reduce the burden on election officials, and to streamline the process of conducting elections in Georgia by promoting uniformity in voting. Several examples will help explain how these goals are achieved;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(5) The broad discretion allowed to local officials for advance voting dates and hours led to significant variations across the state in total number of hours
 of advance voting, depending on the county. More than 100 counties have never offered voting on Sunday and many counties offered only a single day of weekend voting. Requiring two Saturday voting days and two optional Sunday voting days will dramaticall
y increase the total voting hours for voters across the State of Georgia, and all electors in Georgia will have access to multiple opportunities to vote in person on the weekend for the first time;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(6) Some counties in 2020 received significant infusions of grant funding for election operations, while other counties received no such funds. Promoting unif
ormity in the distribution of funds to election operations will boost voter confidence and ensure that there is no political advantage conferred by preferring certain counties over others in the distribution of funds;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(7) Elections in Georgia are administered by counties, but that can lead to problems for voters in counties with dysfunctional election systems. Counties with
 long-term problems of lines, problems with processing of absentee ballots, and other challenges in administration need accountability, but state officials are limited in what they are able to do to address those problems. Ensuring there is a mechanism t
o address local election problems will promote voter confidence and meet the goal of uniformity;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(8) Elections are a public process and public participation is encouraged by all involved, but the enthusiasm of some outside groups in sending multiple absen
tee ballot applications in 2020, often with incorrectly filled-in voter information, led to significant confusion by electors. Clarifying the rules regarding absentee ballot applications will build elector confidence while not sacrificing the opportuniti
es for electors to participate in the process;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(9) The lengthy absentee ballot process also led to elector confusion, including electors who were told they had already voted when they arrived to vote in pe
rson. Creating a definite period of absentee voting will assist electors in understanding the election process while also ensuring that opportunities to vote are not diminished, especially when many absentee ballots issued in the last few days before the
 election were not successfully voted or were returned late;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(10) Opportunities for delivering absentee ballots to a drop box were first created by the State Election Board as a pandemic response. The drop boxes created
 by rule no longer existed in Georgia law when the emergency rules that created them expired. The General Assembly considered a variety of options and constructed a system that allows the use of drop boxes, while also ensuring the security of the system 
and providing options in emergency situations;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(11) The lengthy nine-week runoffs in 2020 were exhausting for candidates, donors, and electors. By adding ranked choice voting for military and overseas vote
rs, the run-off period can be shortened to a more manageable period for all involved, easing the burden on election officials and on electors;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(12) Counting absentee ballots in 2020 took an incredibly long time in some counties. Creating processes for early processing and scanning of absentee ballots
 will promote elector confidence by ensuring that results are reported quickly;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(13) The sanctity of the precinct was also brought into sharp focus in 2020, with many groups approaching electors while they waited in line. Protecting elect
ors from improper interference, political pressure, or intimidation while waiting in line to vote is of paramount importance to protecting the election system and ensuring elector confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(14) Ballot duplication for provisional ballots and other purposes places a heavy burden on election officials. The number of duplicated ballots has continued
 to rise dramatically from 2016 through 2020. Reducing the number of duplicated ballots will significantly reduce the burden on election officials and creating bipartisan panels to conduct duplication will promote elector confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(15) Electors voting out of precinct add to the burden on election officials and lines for other electors because of the length of time it takes to process a 
provisional ballot in a precinct. Electors should be directed to the correct precinct on election day to ensure that they are able to vote in all elections for which they are eligible;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(16) In considering the changes in 2021, the General Assembly heard hours of testimony from electors, election officials, and attorneys involved in voting. Th
e General Assembly made significant modifications through the legislative process as it weighed the various interests involved, including adding further weekend voting, changing parameters for out-of-precinct voting, and adding transparency for ballot im
ages; and
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(17) While each of the changes in this legislation in 2021 stands alone and is severable under Code Section 1-1-3, the changes in total reflect the General As
sembly\'92s considered judgment on the changes required to Georgia\'92s election system to make it \'91easy to vote and hard to cheat,\'92 applying the lessons learned from conducting an election in the 2020 pandemic.\'94

\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(1) Following the 2018 and 2020 elections, there was a significant lack of confidence in Georgia election systems, with many electors concerned about allegati
ons of rampant voter suppression and many electors concerned about allegations of rampant voter fraud;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(2) Many Georgia election processes were challenged in court, including the subjective signature-matching requirements, by Georgians on all sides of the polit
ical spectrum before and after the 2020 general election;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(3) The stress of the 2020 elections, with a dramatic increase in absentee-by-mail ballots and pandemic restrictions, demonstrated where there were opportunit
ies to update existing processes to reduce the burden on election officials and boost voter confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(4) The changes made in this legislation in 2021 are designed to address the lack of elector confidence in the election system on all sides of the political s
pectrum, to reduce the burden on election officials, and to streamline the process of conducting elections in Georgia by promoting uniformity in voting. Several examples will help explain how these goals are achieved;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(5) The broad discretion allowed to local officials for advance voting dates and hours led to significant variations across the state in total number of hours
 of advance voting, depending on the county. More than 100 counties have never offered voting on Sunday and many counties offered only a single day of weekend voting. Requiring two Saturday voting days and two optional Sunday voting days will dramaticall
y increase the total voting hours for voters across the State of Georgia, and all electors in Georgia will have access to multiple opportunities to vote in person on the weekend for the first time;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(6) Some counties in 2020 received significant infusions of grant funding for election operations, while other counties received no such funds. Promoting unif
ormity in the distribution of funds to election operations will boost voter confidence and ensure that there is no political advantage conferred by preferring certain counties over others in the distribution of funds;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(7) Elections in Georgia are administered by counties, but that can lead to problems for voters in counties with dysfunctional election systems. Counties with
 long-term problems of lines, problems with processing of absentee ballots, and other challenges in administration need accountability, but state officials are limited in what they are able to do to address those problems. Ensuring there is a mechanism t
o address local election problems will promote voter confidence and meet the goal of uniformity;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(8) Elections are a public process and public participation is encouraged by all involved, but the enthusiasm of some outside groups in sending multiple absen
tee ballot applications in 2020, often with incorrectly filled-in voter information, led to significant confusion by electors. Clarifying the rules regarding absentee ballot applications will build elector confidence while not sacrificing the opportuniti
es for electors to participate in the process;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(9) The lengthy absentee ballot process also led to elector confusion, including electors who were told they had already voted when they arrived to vote in pe
rson. Creating a definite period of absentee voting will assist electors in understanding the election process while also ensuring that opportunities to vote are not diminished, especially when many absentee ballots issued in the last few days before the
 election were not successfully voted or were returned late;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(10) Opportunities for delivering absentee ballots to a drop box were first created by the State Election Board as a pandemic response. The drop boxes created
 by rule no longer existed in Georgia law when the emergency rules that created them expired. The General Assembly considered a variety of options and constructed a system that allows the use of drop boxes, while also ensuring the security of the system 
and providing options in emergency situations;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(11) The lengthy nine-week runoffs in 2020 were exhausting for candidates, donors, and electors. By adding ranked choice voting for military and overseas vote
rs, the run-off period can be shortened to a more manageable period for all involved, easing the burden on election officials and on electors;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(12) Counting absentee ballots in 2020 took an incredibly long time in some counties. Creating processes for early processing and scanning of absentee ballots
 will promote elector confidence by ensuring that results are reported quickly;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(13) The sanctity of the precinct was also brought into sharp focus in 2020, with many groups approaching electors while they waited in line. Protecting elect
ors from improper interference, political pressure, or intimidation while waiting in line to vote is of paramount importance to protecting the election system and ensuring elector confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(14) Ballot duplication for provisional ballots and other purposes places a heavy burden on election officials. The number of duplicated ballots has continued
 to rise dramatically from 2016 through 2020. Reducing the number of duplicated ballots will significantly reduce the burden on election officials and creating bipartisan panels to conduct duplication will promote elector confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(15) Electors voting out of precinct add to the burden on election officials and lines for other electors because of the length of time it takes to process a 
provisional ballot in a precinct. Electors should be directed to the correct precinct on election day to ensure that they are able to vote in all elections for which they are eligible;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(16) In considering the changes in 2021, the General Assembly heard hours of testimony from electors, election officials, and attorneys involved in voting. Th
e General Assembly made significant modifications through the legislative process as it weighed the various interests involved, including adding further weekend voting, changing parameters for out-of-precinct voting, and adding transparency for ballot im
ages; and
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(17) While each of the changes in this legislation in 2021 stands alone and is severable under Code Section 1-1-3, the changes in total reflect the General As

\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(1) Following the 2018 and 2020 elections, there was a significant lack of confidence in Georgia election systems, with many electors concerned about allegati
ons of rampant voter suppression and many electors concerned about allegations of rampant voter fraud;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(2) Many Georgia election processes were challenged in court, including the subjective signature-matching requirements, by Georgians on all sides of the polit
ical spectrum before and after the 2020 general election;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(3) The stress of the 2020 elections, with a dramatic increase in absentee-by-mail ballots and pandemic restrictions, demonstrated where there were opportunit
ies to update existing processes to reduce the burden on election officials and boost voter confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(4) The changes made in this legislation in 2021 are designed to address the lack of elector confidence in the election system on all sides of the political s
pectrum, to reduce the burden on election officials, and to streamline the process of conducting elections in Georgia by promoting uniformity in voting. Several examples will help explain how these goals are achieved;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(5) The broad discretion allowed to local officials for advance voting dates and hours led to significant variations across the state in total number of hours
 of advance voting, depending on the county. More than 100 counties have never offered voting on Sunday and many counties offered only a single day of weekend voting. Requiring two Saturday voting days and two optional Sunday voting days will dramaticall
y increase the total voting hours for voters across the State of Georgia, and all electors in Georgia will have access to multiple opportunities to vote in person on the weekend for the first time;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(6) Some counties in 2020 received significant infusions of grant funding for election operations, while other counties received no such funds. Promoting unif
ormity in the distribution of funds to election operations will boost voter confidence and ensure that there is no political advantage conferred by preferring certain counties over others in the distribution of funds;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(7) Elections in Georgia are administered by counties, but that can lead to problems for voters in counties with dysfunctional election systems. Counties with
 long-term problems of lines, problems with processing of absentee ballots, and other challenges in administration need accountability, but state officials are limited in what they are able to do to address those problems. Ensuring there is a mechanism t
o address local election problems will promote voter confidence and meet the goal of uniformity;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(8) Elections are a public process and public participation is encouraged by all involved, but the enthusiasm of some outside groups in sending multiple absen
tee ballot applications in 2020, often with incorrectly filled-in voter information, led to significant confusion by electors. Clarifying the rules regarding absentee ballot applications will build elector confidence while not sacrificing the opportuniti
es for electors to participate in the process;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(9) The lengthy absentee ballot process also led to elector confusion, including electors who were told they had already voted when they arrived to vote in pe
rson. Creating a definite period of absentee voting will assist electors in understanding the election process while also ensuring that opportunities to vote are not diminished, especially when many absentee ballots issued in the last few days before the
 election were not successfully voted or were returned late;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(10) Opportunities for delivering absentee ballots to a drop box were first created by the State Election Board as a pandemic response. The drop boxes created
 by rule no longer existed in Georgia law when the emergency rules that created them expired. The General Assembly considered a variety of options and constructed a system that allows the use of drop boxes, while also ensuring the security of the system 
and providing options in emergency situations;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(11) The lengthy nine-week runoffs in 2020 were exhausting for candidates, donors, and electors. By adding ranked choice voting for military and overseas vote
rs, the run-off period can be shortened to a more manageable period for all involved, easing the burden on election officials and on electors;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(12) Counting absentee ballots in 2020 took an incredibly long time in some counties. Creating processes for early processing and scanning of absentee ballots
 will promote elector confidence by ensuring that results are reported quickly;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(13) The sanctity of the precinct was also brought into sharp focus in 2020, with many groups approaching electors while they waited in line. Protecting elect
ors from improper interference, political pressure, or intimidation while waiting in line to vote is of paramount importance to protecting the election system and ensuring elector confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(14) Ballot duplication for provisional ballots and other purposes places a heavy burden on election officials. The number of duplicated ballots has continued
 to rise dramatically from 2016 through 2020. Reducing the number of duplicated ballots will significantly reduce the burden on election officials and creating bipartisan panels to conduct duplication will promote elector confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(15) Electors voting out of precinct add to the burden on election officials and lines for other electors because of the length of time it takes to process a 
provisional ballot in a precinct. Electors should be directed to the correct precinct on election day to ensure that they are able to vote in all elections for which they are eligible;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(16) In considering the changes in 2021, the General Assembly heard hours of testimony from electors, election officials, and attorneys involved in voting. Th
e General Assembly made significant modifications through the legislative process as it weighed the various interests involved, including adding further weekend voting, changing parameters for out-of-precinct voting, and adding transparency for ballot im
ages; and
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(17) While each of the changes in this legislation in 2021 stands alone and is severable under Code Section 1-1-3, the changes in total reflect the General As
sembly\'92s considered judgment on the changes required to Georgia\'92s election system to make it \'91easy to vote and hard to cheat,\'92 applying the lessons learned from conducting an election in the 2020 pandemic.\'94

\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(1) Following the 2018 and 2020 elections, there was a significant lack of confidence in Georgia election systems, with many electors concerned about allegati
ons of rampant voter suppression and many electors concerned about allegations of rampant voter fraud;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(2) Many Georgia election processes were challenged in court, including the subjective signature-matching requirements, by Georgians on all sides of the polit
ical spectrum before and after the 2020 general election;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(3) The stress of the 2020 elections, with a dramatic increase in absentee-by-mail ballots and pandemic restrictions, demonstrated where there were opportunit
ies to update existing processes to reduce the burden on election officials and boost voter confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(4) The changes made in this legislation in 2021 are designed to address the lack of elector confidence in the election system on all sides of the political s
pectrum, to reduce the burden on election officials, and to streamline the process of conducting elections in Georgia by promoting uniformity in voting. Several examples will help explain how these goals are achieved;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(5) The broad discretion allowed to local officials for advance voting dates and hours led to significant variations across the state in total number of hours
 of advance voting, depending on the county. More than 100 counties have never offered voting on Sunday and many counties offered only a single day of weekend voting. Requiring two Saturday voting days and two optional Sunday voting days will dramaticall
y increase the total voting hours for voters across the State of Georgia, and all electors in Georgia will have access to multiple opportunities to vote in person on the weekend for the first time;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(6) Some counties in 2020 received significant infusions of grant funding for election operations, while other counties received no such funds. Promoting unif
ormity in the distribution of funds to election operations will boost voter confidence and ensure that there is no political advantage conferred by preferring certain counties over others in the distribution of funds;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(7) Elections in Georgia are administered by counties, but that can lead to problems for voters in counties with dysfunctional election systems. Counties with
 long-term problems of lines, problems with processing of absentee ballots, and other challenges in administration need accountability, but state officials are limited in what they are able to do to address those problems. Ensuring there is a mechanism t
o address local election problems will promote voter confidence and meet the goal of uniformity;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(8) Elections are a public process and public participation is encouraged by all involved, but the enthusiasm of some outside groups in sending multiple absen
tee ballot applications in 2020, often with incorrectly filled-in voter information, led to significant confusion by electors. Clarifying the rules regarding absentee ballot applications will build elector confidence while not sacrificing the opportuniti
es for electors to participate in the process;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(9) The lengthy absentee ballot process also led to elector confusion, including electors who were told they had already voted when they arrived to vote in pe
rson. Creating a definite period of absentee voting will assist electors in understanding the election process while also ensuring that opportunities to vote are not diminished, especially when many absentee ballots issued in the last few days before the
 election were not successfully voted or were returned late;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(10) Opportunities for delivering absentee ballots to a drop box were first created by the State Election Board as a pandemic response. The drop boxes created
 by rule no longer existed in Georgia law when the emergency rules that created them expired. The General Assembly considered a variety of options and constructed a system that allows the use of drop boxes, while also ensuring the security of the system 
and providing options in emergency situations;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(11) The lengthy nine-week runoffs in 2020 were exhausting for candidates, donors, and electors. By adding ranked choice voting for military and overseas vote
rs, the run-off period can be shortened to a more manageable period for all involved, easing the burden on election officials and on electors;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(12) Counting absentee ballots in 2020 took an incredibly long time in some counties. Creating processes for early processing and scanning of absentee ballots
 will promote elector confidence by ensuring that results are reported quickly;

ho were not eligible to hold office, as these people did not give proper notice of their intention of candidacy; (2) no voters were disenfranchised; (3) each voter was given the opportunity to vote for the candidate of his or her own choosing; and (4) th

\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(1) Following the 2018 and 2020 elections, there was a significant lack of confidence in Georgia election systems, with many electors concerned about allegati
ons of rampant voter suppression and many electors concerned about allegations of rampant voter fraud;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(2) Many Georgia election processes were challenged in court, including the subjective signature-matching requirements, by Georgians on all sides of the polit
ical spectrum before and after the 2020 general election;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(3) The stress of the 2020 elections, with a dramatic increase in absentee-by-mail ballots and pandemic restrictions, demonstrated where there were opportunit
ies to update existing processes to reduce the burden on election officials and boost voter confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(4) The changes made in this legislation in 2021 are designed to address the lack of elector confidence in the election system on all sides of the political s
pectrum, to reduce the burden on election officials, and to streamline the process of conducting elections in Georgia by promoting uniformity in voting. Several examples will help explain how these goals are achieved;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(5) The broad discretion allowed to local officials for advance voting dates and hours led to significant variations across the state in total number of hours
 of advance voting, depending on the county. More than 100 counties have never offered voting on Sunday and many counties offered only a single day of weekend voting. Requiring two Saturday voting days and two optional Sunday voting days will dramaticall
y increase the total voting hours for voters across the State of Georgia, and all electors in Georgia will have access to multiple opportunities to vote in person on the weekend for the first time;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(6) Some counties in 2020 received significant infusions of grant funding for election operations, while other counties received no such funds. Promoting unif
ormity in the distribution of funds to election operations will boost voter confidence and ensure that there is no political advantage conferred by preferring certain counties over others in the distribution of funds;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(7) Elections in Georgia are administered by counties, but that can lead to problems for voters in counties with dysfunctional election systems. Counties with
 long-term problems of lines, problems with processing of absentee ballots, and other challenges in administration need accountability, but state officials are limited in what they are able to do to address those problems. Ensuring there is a mechanism t
o address local election problems will promote voter confidence and meet the goal of uniformity;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(8) Elections are a public process and public participation is encouraged by all involved, but the enthusiasm of some outside groups in sending multiple absen
tee ballot applications in 2020, often with incorrectly filled-in voter information, led to significant confusion by electors. Clarifying the rules regarding absentee ballot applications will build elector confidence while not sacrificing the opportuniti
es for electors to participate in the process;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(9) The lengthy absentee ballot process also led to elector confusion, including electors who were told they had already voted when they arrived to vote in pe
rson. Creating a definite period of absentee voting will assist electors in understanding the election process while also ensuring that opportunities to vote are not diminished, especially when many absentee ballots issued in the last few days before the
 election were not successfully voted or were returned late;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(10) Opportunities for delivering absentee ballots to a drop box were first created by the State Election Board as a pandemic response. The drop boxes created
 by rule no longer existed in Georgia law when the emergency rules that created them expired. The General Assembly considered a variety of options and constructed a system that allows the use of drop boxes, while also ensuring the security of the system 
and providing options in emergency situations;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(11) The lengthy nine-week runoffs in 2020 were exhausting for candidates, donors, and electors. By adding ranked choice voting for military and overseas vote
rs, the run-off period can be shortened to a more manageable period for all involved, easing the burden on election officials and on electors;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(12) Counting absentee ballots in 2020 took an incredibly long time in some counties. Creating processes for early processing and scanning of absentee ballots
 will promote elector confidence by ensuring that results are reported quickly;

\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(1) Following the 2018 and 2020 elections, there was a significant lack of confidence in Georgia election systems, with many electors concerned about allegati
ons of rampant voter suppression and many electors concerned about allegations of rampant voter fraud;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(2) Many Georgia election processes were challenged in court, including the subjective signature-matching requirements, by Georgians on all sides of the polit
ical spectrum before and after the 2020 general election;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(3) The stress of the 2020 elections, with a dramatic increase in absentee-by-mail ballots and pandemic restrictions, demonstrated where there were opportunit
ies to update existing processes to reduce the burden on election officials and boost voter confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(4) The changes made in this legislation in 2021 are designed to address the lack of elector confidence in the election system on all sides of the political s
pectrum, to reduce the burden on election officials, and to streamline the process of conducting elections in Georgia by promoting uniformity in voting. Several examples will help explain how these goals are achieved;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(5) The broad discretion allowed to local officials for advance voting dates and hours led to significant variations across the state in total number of hours
 of advance voting, depending on the county. More than 100 counties have never offered voting on Sunday and many counties offered only a single day of weekend voting. Requiring two Saturday voting days and two optional Sunday voting days will dramaticall
y increase the total voting hours for voters across the State of Georgia, and all electors in Georgia will have access to multiple opportunities to vote in person on the weekend for the first time;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(6) Some counties in 2020 received significant infusions of grant funding for election operations, while other counties received no such funds. Promoting unif
ormity in the distribution of funds to election operations will boost voter confidence and ensure that there is no political advantage conferred by preferring certain counties over others in the distribution of funds;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(7) Elections in Georgia are administered by counties, but that can lead to problems for voters in counties with dysfunctional election systems. Counties with
 long-term problems of lines, problems with processing of absentee ballots, and other challenges in administration need accountability, but state officials are limited in what they are able to do to address those problems. Ensuring there is a mechanism t
o address local election problems will promote voter confidence and meet the goal of uniformity;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(8) Elections are a public process and public participation is encouraged by all involved, but the enthusiasm of some outside groups in sending multiple absen
tee ballot applications in 2020, often with incorrectly filled-in voter information, led to significant confusion by electors. Clarifying the rules regarding absentee ballot applications will build elector confidence while not sacrificing the opportuniti
es for electors to participate in the process;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(9) The lengthy absentee ballot process also led to elector confusion, including electors who were told they had already voted when they arrived to vote in pe
rson. Creating a definite period of absentee voting will assist electors in understanding the election process while also ensuring that opportunities to vote are not diminished, especially when many absentee ballots issued in the last few days before the
 election were not successfully voted or were returned late;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(10) Opportunities for delivering absentee ballots to a drop box were first created by the State Election Board as a pandemic response. The drop boxes created
 by rule no longer existed in Georgia law when the emergency rules that created them expired. The General Assembly considered a variety of options and constructed a system that allows the use of drop boxes, while also ensuring the security of the system 
and providing options in emergency situations;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(11) The lengthy nine-week runoffs in 2020 were exhausting for candidates, donors, and electors. By adding ranked choice voting for military and overseas vote
rs, the run-off period can be shortened to a more manageable period for all involved, easing the burden on election officials and on electors;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(12) Counting absentee ballots in 2020 took an incredibly long time in some counties. Creating processes for early processing and scanning of absentee ballots
 will promote elector confidence by ensuring that results are reported quickly;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(13) The sanctity of the precinct was also brought into sharp focus in 2020, with many groups approaching electors while they waited in line. Protecting elect
ors from improper interference, political pressure, or intimidation while waiting in line to vote is of paramount importance to protecting the election system and ensuring elector confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(14) Ballot duplication for provisional ballots and other purposes places a heavy burden on election officials. The number of duplicated ballots has continued
 to rise dramatically from 2016 through 2020. Reducing the number of duplicated ballots will significantly reduce the burden on election officials and creating bipartisan panels to conduct duplication will promote elector confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(15) Electors voting out of precinct add to the burden on election officials and lines for other electors because of the length of time it takes to process a 
provisional ballot in a precinct. Electors should be directed to the correct precinct on election day to ensure that they are able to vote in all elections for which they are eligible;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(16) In considering the changes in 2021, the General Assembly heard hours of testimony from electors, election officials, and attorneys involved in voting. Th

arty submission of individual voter registration forms and specifically required that states should register all voters that timely mailed in valid voter registration forms; and (4) Georgia\'92s anti-bundling policy did little, if anything, to prevent fr

\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(1) Following the 2018 and 2020 elections, there was a significant lack of confidence in Georgia election systems, with many electors concerned about allegati
ons of rampant voter suppression and many electors concerned about allegations of rampant voter fraud;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(2) Many Georgia election processes were challenged in court, including the subjective signature-matching requirements, by Georgians on all sides of the polit
ical spectrum before and after the 2020 general election;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(3) The stress of the 2020 elections, with a dramatic increase in absentee-by-mail ballots and pandemic restrictions, demonstrated where there were opportunit
ies to update existing processes to reduce the burden on election officials and boost voter confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(4) The changes made in this legislation in 2021 are designed to address the lack of elector confidence in the election system on all sides of the political s
pectrum, to reduce the burden on election officials, and to streamline the process of conducting elections in Georgia by promoting uniformity in voting. Several examples will help explain how these goals are achieved;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(5) The broad discretion allowed to local officials for advance voting dates and hours led to significant variations across the state in total number of hours
 of advance voting, depending on the county. More than 100 counties have never offered voting on Sunday and many counties offered only a single day of weekend voting. Requiring two Saturday voting days and two optional Sunday voting days will dramaticall
y increase the total voting hours for voters across the State of Georgia, and all electors in Georgia will have access to multiple opportunities to vote in person on the weekend for the first time;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(6) Some counties in 2020 received significant infusions of grant funding for election operations, while other counties received no such funds. Promoting unif
ormity in the distribution of funds to election operations will boost voter confidence and ensure that there is no political advantage conferred by preferring certain counties over others in the distribution of funds;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(7) Elections in Georgia are administered by counties, but that can lead to problems for voters in counties with dysfunctional election systems. Counties with
 long-term problems of lines, problems with processing of absentee ballots, and other challenges in administration need accountability, but state officials are limited in what they are able to do to address those problems. Ensuring there is a mechanism t
o address local election problems will promote voter confidence and meet the goal of uniformity;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(8) Elections are a public process and public participation is encouraged by all involved, but the enthusiasm of some outside groups in sending multiple absen
tee ballot applications in 2020, often with incorrectly filled-in voter information, led to significant confusion by electors. Clarifying the rules regarding absentee ballot applications will build elector confidence while not sacrificing the opportuniti
es for electors to participate in the process;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(9) The lengthy absentee ballot process also led to elector confusion, including electors who were told they had already voted when they arrived to vote in pe
rson. Creating a definite period of absentee voting will assist electors in understanding the election process while also ensuring that opportunities to vote are not diminished, especially when many absentee ballots issued in the last few days before the
 election were not successfully voted or were returned late;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(10) Opportunities for delivering absentee ballots to a drop box were first created by the State Election Board as a pandemic response. The drop boxes created
 by rule no longer existed in Georgia law when the emergency rules that created them expired. The General Assembly considered a variety of options and constructed a system that allows the use of drop boxes, while also ensuring the security of the system 
and providing options in emergency situations;

\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(1) Following the 2018 and 2020 elections, there was a significant lack of confidence in Georgia election systems, with many electors concerned about allegati

\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(2) Many Georgia election processes were challenged in court, including the subjective signature-matching requirements, by Georgians on all sides of the polit

\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(3) The stress of the 2020 elections, with a dramatic increase in absentee-by-mail ballots and pandemic restrictions, demonstrated where there were opportunit
ies to update existing processes to reduce the burden on election officials and boost voter confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(4) The changes made in this legislation in 2021 are designed to address the lack of elector confidence in the election system on all sides of the political s
pectrum, to reduce the burden on election officials, and to streamline the process of conducting elections in Georgia by promoting uniformity in voting. Several examples will help explain how these goals are achieved;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(5) The broad discretion allowed to local officials for advance voting dates and hours led to significant variations across the state in total number of hours
 of advance voting, depending on the county. More than 100 counties have never offered voting on Sunday and many counties offered only a single day of weekend voting. Requiring two Saturday voting days and two optional Sunday voting days will dramaticall
y increase the total voting hours for voters across the State of Georgia, and all electors in Georgia will have access to multiple opportunities to vote in person on the weekend for the first time;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(6) Some counties in 2020 received significant infusions of grant funding for election operations, while other counties received no such funds. Promoting unif
ormity in the distribution of funds to election operations will boost voter confidence and ensure that there is no political advantage conferred by preferring certain counties over others in the distribution of funds;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(7) Elections in Georgia are administered by counties, but that can lead to problems for voters in counties with dysfunctional election systems. Counties with
 long-term problems of lines, problems with processing of absentee ballots, and other challenges in administration need accountability, but state officials are limited in what they are able to do to address those problems. Ensuring there is a mechanism t
o address local election problems will promote voter confidence and meet the goal of uniformity;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(8) Elections are a public process and public participation is encouraged by all involved, but the enthusiasm of some outside groups in sending multiple absen
tee ballot applications in 2020, often with incorrectly filled-in voter information, led to significant confusion by electors. Clarifying the rules regarding absentee ballot applications will build elector confidence while not sacrificing the opportuniti

\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(9) The lengthy absentee ballot process also led to elector confusion, including electors who were told they had already voted when they arrived to vote in pe
rson. Creating a definite period of absentee voting will assist electors in understanding the election process while also ensuring that opportunities to vote are not diminished, especially when many absentee ballots issued in the last few days before the
 election were not successfully voted or were returned late;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(10) Opportunities for delivering absentee ballots to a drop box were first created by the State Election Board as a pandemic response. The drop boxes created
 by rule no longer existed in Georgia law when the emergency rules that created them expired. The General Assembly considered a variety of options and constructed a system that allows the use of drop boxes, while also ensuring the security of the system 
and providing options in emergency situations;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(11) The lengthy nine-week runoffs in 2020 were exhausting for candidates, donors, and electors. By adding ranked choice voting for military and overseas vote
rs, the run-off period can be shortened to a more manageable period for all involved, easing the burden on election officials and on electors;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(12) Counting absentee ballots in 2020 took an incredibly long time in some counties. Creating processes for early processing and scanning of absentee ballots

\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(13) The sanctity of the precinct was also brought into sharp focus in 2020, with many groups approaching electors while they waited in line. Protecting elect
ors from improper interference, political pressure, or intimidation while waiting in line to vote is of paramount importance to protecting the election system and ensuring elector confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(14) Ballot duplication for provisional ballots and other purposes places a heavy burden on election officials. The number of duplicated ballots has continued
 to rise dramatically from 2016 through 2020. Reducing the number of duplicated ballots will significantly reduce the burden on election officials and creating bipartisan panels to conduct duplication will promote elector confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(15) Electors voting out of precinct add to the burden on election officials and lines for other electors because of the length of time it takes to process a 
provisional ballot in a precinct. Electors should be directed to the correct precinct on election day to ensure that they are able to vote in all elections for which they are eligible;

\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(1) Following the 2018 and 2020 elections, there was a significant lack of confidence in Georgia election systems, with many electors concerned about allegati
ons of rampant voter suppression and many electors concerned about allegations of rampant voter fraud;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(2) Many Georgia election processes were challenged in court, including the subjective signature-matching requirements, by Georgians on all sides of the polit
ical spectrum before and after the 2020 general election;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(3) The stress of the 2020 elections, with a dramatic increase in absentee-by-mail ballots and pandemic restrictions, demonstrated where there were opportunit
ies to update existing processes to reduce the burden on election officials and boost voter confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(4) The changes made in this legislation in 2021 are designed to address the lack of elector confidence in the election system on all sides of the political s
pectrum, to reduce the burden on election officials, and to streamline the process of conducting elections in Georgia by promoting uniformity in voting. Several examples will help explain how these goals are achieved;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(5) The broad discretion allowed to local officials for advance voting dates and hours led to significant variations across the state in total number of hours
 of advance voting, depending on the county. More than 100 counties have never offered voting on Sunday and many counties offered only a single day of weekend voting. Requiring two Saturday voting days and two optional Sunday voting days will dramaticall
y increase the total voting hours for voters across the State of Georgia, and all electors in Georgia will have access to multiple opportunities to vote in person on the weekend for the first time;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(6) Some counties in 2020 received significant infusions of grant funding for election operations, while other counties received no such funds. Promoting unif
ormity in the distribution of funds to election operations will boost voter confidence and ensure that there is no political advantage conferred by preferring certain counties over others in the distribution of funds;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(7) Elections in Georgia are administered by counties, but that can lead to problems for voters in counties with dysfunctional election systems. Counties with
 long-term problems of lines, problems with processing of absentee ballots, and other challenges in administration need accountability, but state officials are limited in what they are able to do to address those problems. Ensuring there is a mechanism t
o address local election problems will promote voter confidence and meet the goal of uniformity;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(8) Elections are a public process and public participation is encouraged by all involved, but the enthusiasm of some outside groups in sending multiple absen
tee ballot applications in 2020, often with incorrectly filled-in voter information, led to significant confusion by electors. Clarifying the rules regarding absentee ballot applications will build elector confidence while not sacrificing the opportuniti
es for electors to participate in the process;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(9) The lengthy absentee ballot process also led to elector confusion, including electors who were told they had already voted when they arrived to vote in pe
rson. Creating a definite period of absentee voting will assist electors in understanding the election process while also ensuring that opportunities to vote are not diminished, especially when many absentee ballots issued in the last few days before the
 election were not successfully voted or were returned late;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(10) Opportunities for delivering absentee ballots to a drop box were first created by the State Election Board as a pandemic response. The drop boxes created
 by rule no longer existed in Georgia law when the emergency rules that created them expired. The General Assembly considered a variety of options and constructed a system that allows the use of drop boxes, while also ensuring the security of the system 
and providing options in emergency situations;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(11) The lengthy nine-week runoffs in 2020 were exhausting for candidates, donors, and electors. By adding ranked choice voting for military and overseas vote
rs, the run-off period can be shortened to a more manageable period for all involved, easing the burden on election officials and on electors;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(12) Counting absentee ballots in 2020 took an incredibly long time in some counties. Creating processes for early processing and scanning of absentee ballots
 will promote elector confidence by ensuring that results are reported quickly;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(13) The sanctity of the precinct was also brought into sharp focus in 2020, with many groups approaching electors while they waited in line. Protecting elect
ors from improper interference, political pressure, or intimidation while waiting in line to vote is of paramount importance to protecting the election system and ensuring elector confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(14) Ballot duplication for provisional ballots and other purposes places a heavy burden on election officials. The number of duplicated ballots has continued
 to rise dramatically from 2016 through 2020. Reducing the number of duplicated ballots will significantly reduce the burden on election officials and creating bipartisan panels to conduct duplication will promote elector confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(15) Electors voting out of precinct add to the burden on election officials and lines for other electors because of the length of time it takes to process a 
provisional ballot in a precinct. Electors should be directed to the correct precinct on election day to ensure that they are able to vote in all elections for which they are eligible;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(16) In considering the changes in 2021, the General Assembly heard hours of testimony from electors, election officials, and attorneys involved in voting. Th
e General Assembly made significant modifications through the legislative process as it weighed the various interests involved, including adding further weekend voting, changing parameters for out-of-precinct voting, and adding transparency for ballot im
ages; and
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(17) While each of the changes in this legislation in 2021 stands alone and is severable under Code Section 1-1-3, the changes in total reflect the General As
sembly\'92s considered judgment on the changes required to Georgia\'92s election system to make it \'91easy to vote and hard to cheat,\'92 applying the lessons learned from conducting an election in the 2020 pandemic.\'94

\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(1) Following the 2018 and 2020 elections, there was a significant lack of confidence in Georgia election systems, with many electors concerned about allegati
ons of rampant voter suppression and many electors concerned about allegations of rampant voter fraud;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(2) Many Georgia election processes were challenged in court, including the subjective signature-matching requirements, by Georgians on all sides of the polit
ical spectrum before and after the 2020 general election;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(3) The stress of the 2020 elections, with a dramatic increase in absentee-by-mail ballots and pandemic restrictions, demonstrated where there were opportunit
ies to update existing processes to reduce the burden on election officials and boost voter confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(4) The changes made in this legislation in 2021 are designed to address the lack of elector confidence in the election system on all sides of the political s
pectrum, to reduce the burden on election officials, and to streamline the process of conducting elections in Georgia by promoting uniformity in voting. Several examples will help explain how these goals are achieved;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(5) The broad discretion allowed to local officials for advance voting dates and hours led to significant variations across the state in total number of hours
 of advance voting, depending on the county. More than 100 counties have never offered voting on Sunday and many counties offered only a single day of weekend voting. Requiring two Saturday voting days and two optional Sunday voting days will dramaticall
y increase the total voting hours for voters across the State of Georgia, and all electors in Georgia will have access to multiple opportunities to vote in person on the weekend for the first time;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(6) Some counties in 2020 received significant infusions of grant funding for election operations, while other counties received no such funds. Promoting unif
ormity in the distribution of funds to election operations will boost voter confidence and ensure that there is no political advantage conferred by preferring certain counties over others in the distribution of funds;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(7) Elections in Georgia are administered by counties, but that can lead to problems for voters in counties with dysfunctional election systems. Counties with
 long-term problems of lines, problems with processing of absentee ballots, and other challenges in administration need accountability, but state officials are limited in what they are able to do to address those problems. Ensuring there is a mechanism t
o address local election problems will promote voter confidence and meet the goal of uniformity;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(8) Elections are a public process and public participation is encouraged by all involved, but the enthusiasm of some outside groups in sending multiple absen
tee ballot applications in 2020, often with incorrectly filled-in voter information, led to significant confusion by electors. Clarifying the rules regarding absentee ballot applications will build elector confidence while not sacrificing the opportuniti
es for electors to participate in the process;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(9) The lengthy absentee ballot process also led to elector confusion, including electors who were told they had already voted when they arrived to vote in pe
rson. Creating a definite period of absentee voting will assist electors in understanding the election process while also ensuring that opportunities to vote are not diminished, especially when many absentee ballots issued in the last few days before the
 election were not successfully voted or were returned late;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(10) Opportunities for delivering absentee ballots to a drop box were first created by the State Election Board as a pandemic response. The drop boxes created
 by rule no longer existed in Georgia law when the emergency rules that created them expired. The General Assembly considered a variety of options and constructed a system that allows the use of drop boxes, while also ensuring the security of the system 
and providing options in emergency situations;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(11) The lengthy nine-week runoffs in 2020 were exhausting for candidates, donors, and electors. By adding ranked choice voting for military and overseas vote
rs, the run-off period can be shortened to a more manageable period for all involved, easing the burden on election officials and on electors;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(12) Counting absentee ballots in 2020 took an incredibly long time in some counties. Creating processes for early processing and scanning of absentee ballots
 will promote elector confidence by ensuring that results are reported quickly;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(13) The sanctity of the precinct was also brought into sharp focus in 2020, with many groups approaching electors while they waited in line. Protecting elect
ors from improper interference, political pressure, or intimidation while waiting in line to vote is of paramount importance to protecting the election system and ensuring elector confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(14) Ballot duplication for provisional ballots and other purposes places a heavy burden on election officials. The number of duplicated ballots has continued
 to rise dramatically from 2016 through 2020. Reducing the number of duplicated ballots will significantly reduce the burden on election officials and creating bipartisan panels to conduct duplication will promote elector confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(15) Electors voting out of precinct add to the burden on election officials and lines for other electors because of the length of time it takes to process a 
provisional ballot in a precinct. Electors should be directed to the correct precinct on election day to ensure that they are able to vote in all elections for which they are eligible;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(16) In considering the changes in 2021, the General Assembly heard hours of testimony from electors, election officials, and attorneys involved in voting. Th
e General Assembly made significant modifications through the legislative process as it weighed the various interests involved, including adding further weekend voting, changing parameters for out-of-precinct voting, and adding transparency for ballot im
ages; and
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(17) While each of the changes in this legislation in 2021 stands alone and is severable under Code Section 1-1-3, the changes in total reflect the General As

\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(1) Following the 2018 and 2020 elections, there was a significant lack of confidence in Georgia election systems, with many electors concerned about allegati
ons of rampant voter suppression and many electors concerned about allegations of rampant voter fraud;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(2) Many Georgia election processes were challenged in court, including the subjective signature-matching requirements, by Georgians on all sides of the polit
ical spectrum before and after the 2020 general election;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(3) The stress of the 2020 elections, with a dramatic increase in absentee-by-mail ballots and pandemic restrictions, demonstrated where there were opportunit
ies to update existing processes to reduce the burden on election officials and boost voter confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(4) The changes made in this legislation in 2021 are designed to address the lack of elector confidence in the election system on all sides of the political s
pectrum, to reduce the burden on election officials, and to streamline the process of conducting elections in Georgia by promoting uniformity in voting. Several examples will help explain how these goals are achieved;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(5) The broad discretion allowed to local officials for advance voting dates and hours led to significant variations across the state in total number of hours
 of advance voting, depending on the county. More than 100 counties have never offered voting on Sunday and many counties offered only a single day of weekend voting. Requiring two Saturday voting days and two optional Sunday voting days will dramaticall
y increase the total voting hours for voters across the State of Georgia, and all electors in Georgia will have access to multiple opportunities to vote in person on the weekend for the first time;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(6) Some counties in 2020 received significant infusions of grant funding for election operations, while other counties received no such funds. Promoting unif
ormity in the distribution of funds to election operations will boost voter confidence and ensure that there is no political advantage conferred by preferring certain counties over others in the distribution of funds;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(7) Elections in Georgia are administered by counties, but that can lead to problems for voters in counties with dysfunctional election systems. Counties with
 long-term problems of lines, problems with processing of absentee ballots, and other challenges in administration need accountability, but state officials are limited in what they are able to do to address those problems. Ensuring there is a mechanism t
o address local election problems will promote voter confidence and meet the goal of uniformity;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(8) Elections are a public process and public participation is encouraged by all involved, but the enthusiasm of some outside groups in sending multiple absen
tee ballot applications in 2020, often with incorrectly filled-in voter information, led to significant confusion by electors. Clarifying the rules regarding absentee ballot applications will build elector confidence while not sacrificing the opportuniti
es for electors to participate in the process;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(9) The lengthy absentee ballot process also led to elector confusion, including electors who were told they had already voted when they arrived to vote in pe
rson. Creating a definite period of absentee voting will assist electors in understanding the election process while also ensuring that opportunities to vote are not diminished, especially when many absentee ballots issued in the last few days before the
 election were not successfully voted or were returned late;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(10) Opportunities for delivering absentee ballots to a drop box were first created by the State Election Board as a pandemic response. The drop boxes created
 by rule no longer existed in Georgia law when the emergency rules that created them expired. The General Assembly considered a variety of options and constructed a system that allows the use of drop boxes, while also ensuring the security of the system 
and providing options in emergency situations;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(11) The lengthy nine-week runoffs in 2020 were exhausting for candidates, donors, and electors. By adding ranked choice voting for military and overseas vote
rs, the run-off period can be shortened to a more manageable period for all involved, easing the burden on election officials and on electors;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(12) Counting absentee ballots in 2020 took an incredibly long time in some counties. Creating processes for early processing and scanning of absentee ballots
 will promote elector confidence by ensuring that results are reported quickly;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(13) The sanctity of the precinct was also brought into sharp focus in 2020, with many groups approaching electors while they waited in line. Protecting elect
ors from improper interference, political pressure, or intimidation while waiting in line to vote is of paramount importance to protecting the election system and ensuring elector confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(14) Ballot duplication for provisional ballots and other purposes places a heavy burden on election officials. The number of duplicated ballots has continued
 to rise dramatically from 2016 through 2020. Reducing the number of duplicated ballots will significantly reduce the burden on election officials and creating bipartisan panels to conduct duplication will promote elector confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(15) Electors voting out of precinct add to the burden on election officials and lines for other electors because of the length of time it takes to process a 
provisional ballot in a precinct. Electors should be directed to the correct precinct on election day to ensure that they are able to vote in all elections for which they are eligible;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(16) In considering the changes in 2021, the General Assembly heard hours of testimony from electors, election officials, and attorneys involved in voting. Th
e General Assembly made significant modifications through the legislative process as it weighed the various interests involved, including adding further weekend voting, changing parameters for out-of-precinct voting, and adding transparency for ballot im
ages; and
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(17) While each of the changes in this legislation in 2021 stands alone and is severable under Code Section 1-1-3, the changes in total reflect the General As
sembly\'92s considered judgment on the changes required to Georgia\'92s election system to make it \'91easy to vote and hard to cheat,\'92 applying the lessons learned from conducting an election in the 2020 pandemic.\'94

\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(1) Following the 2018 and 2020 elections, there was a significant lack of confidence in Georgia election systems, with many electors concerned about allegati
ons of rampant voter suppression and many electors concerned about allegations of rampant voter fraud;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(2) Many Georgia election processes were challenged in court, including the subjective signature-matching requirements, by Georgians on all sides of the polit
ical spectrum before and after the 2020 general election;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(3) The stress of the 2020 elections, with a dramatic increase in absentee-by-mail ballots and pandemic restrictions, demonstrated where there were opportunit
ies to update existing processes to reduce the burden on election officials and boost voter confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(4) The changes made in this legislation in 2021 are designed to address the lack of elector confidence in the election system on all sides of the political s
pectrum, to reduce the burden on election officials, and to streamline the process of conducting elections in Georgia by promoting uniformity in voting. Several examples will help explain how these goals are achieved;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(5) The broad discretion allowed to local officials for advance voting dates and hours led to significant variations across the state in total number of hours
 of advance voting, depending on the county. More than 100 counties have never offered voting on Sunday and many counties offered only a single day of weekend voting. Requiring two Saturday voting days and two optional Sunday voting days will dramaticall
y increase the total voting hours for voters across the State of Georgia, and all electors in Georgia will have access to multiple opportunities to vote in person on the weekend for the first time;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(6) Some counties in 2020 received significant infusions of grant funding for election operations, while other counties received no such funds. Promoting unif
ormity in the distribution of funds to election operations will boost voter confidence and ensure that there is no political advantage conferred by preferring certain counties over others in the distribution of funds;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(7) Elections in Georgia are administered by counties, but that can lead to problems for voters in counties with dysfunctional election systems. Counties with
 long-term problems of lines, problems with processing of absentee ballots, and other challenges in administration need accountability, but state officials are limited in what they are able to do to address those problems. Ensuring there is a mechanism t
o address local election problems will promote voter confidence and meet the goal of uniformity;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(8) Elections are a public process and public participation is encouraged by all involved, but the enthusiasm of some outside groups in sending multiple absen
tee ballot applications in 2020, often with incorrectly filled-in voter information, led to significant confusion by electors. Clarifying the rules regarding absentee ballot applications will build elector confidence while not sacrificing the opportuniti
es for electors to participate in the process;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(9) The lengthy absentee ballot process also led to elector confusion, including electors who were told they had already voted when they arrived to vote in pe
rson. Creating a definite period of absentee voting will assist electors in understanding the election process while also ensuring that opportunities to vote are not diminished, especially when many absentee ballots issued in the last few days before the
 election were not successfully voted or were returned late;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(10) Opportunities for delivering absentee ballots to a drop box were first created by the State Election Board as a pandemic response. The drop boxes created
 by rule no longer existed in Georgia law when the emergency rules that created them expired. The General Assembly considered a variety of options and constructed a system that allows the use of drop boxes, while also ensuring the security of the system 
and providing options in emergency situations;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(11) The lengthy nine-week runoffs in 2020 were exhausting for candidates, donors, and electors. By adding ranked choice voting for military and overseas vote
rs, the run-off period can be shortened to a more manageable period for all involved, easing the burden on election officials and on electors;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(12) Counting absentee ballots in 2020 took an incredibly long time in some counties. Creating processes for early processing and scanning of absentee ballots
 will promote elector confidence by ensuring that results are reported quickly;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(13) The sanctity of the precinct was also brought into sharp focus in 2020, with many groups approaching electors while they waited in line. Protecting elect
ors from improper interference, political pressure, or intimidation while waiting in line to vote is of paramount importance to protecting the election system and ensuring elector confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(14) Ballot duplication for provisional ballots and other purposes places a heavy burden on election officials. The number of duplicated ballots has continued
 to rise dramatically from 2016 through 2020. Reducing the number of duplicated ballots will significantly reduce the burden on election officials and creating bipartisan panels to conduct duplication will promote elector confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(15) Electors voting out of precinct add to the burden on election officials and lines for other electors because of the length of time it takes to process a 
provisional ballot in a precinct. Electors should be directed to the correct precinct on election day to ensure that they are able to vote in all elections for which they are eligible;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(16) In considering the changes in 2021, the General Assembly heard hours of testimony from electors, election officials, and attorneys involved in voting. Th
e General Assembly made significant modifications through the legislative process as it weighed the various interests involved, including adding further weekend voting, changing parameters for out-of-precinct voting, and adding transparency for ballot im
ages; and
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(17) While each of the changes in this legislation in 2021 stands alone and is severable under Code Section 1-1-3, the changes in total reflect the General As
sembly\'92s considered judgment on the changes required to Georgia\'92s election system to make it \'91easy to vote and hard to cheat,\'92 applying the lessons learned from conducting an election in the 2020 pandemic.\'94

 to meet the burden of establishing that any misconduct, fraud, or irregularity occurred that placed the result of the election in doubt based on the county clerk signing the document reflecting the election results, instead of the election superintenden
t, and the clerk\'92s failure to purge the voters list, which was not an obligation of the election supervisor anyway. The omission of the statutory language providing directions on how to cast a vote likewise did not necessitate a new election since the

\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(1) Following the 2018 and 2020 elections, there was a significant lack of confidence in Georgia election systems, with many electors concerned about allegati
ons of rampant voter suppression and many electors concerned about allegations of rampant voter fraud;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(2) Many Georgia election processes were challenged in court, including the subjective signature-matching requirements, by Georgians on all sides of the polit
ical spectrum before and after the 2020 general election;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(3) The stress of the 2020 elections, with a dramatic increase in absentee-by-mail ballots and pandemic restrictions, demonstrated where there were opportunit
ies to update existing processes to reduce the burden on election officials and boost voter confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(4) The changes made in this legislation in 2021 are designed to address the lack of elector confidence in the election system on all sides of the political s
pectrum, to reduce the burden on election officials, and to streamline the process of conducting elections in Georgia by promoting uniformity in voting. Several examples will help explain how these goals are achieved;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(5) The broad discretion allowed to local officials for advance voting dates and hours led to significant variations across the state in total number of hours
 of advance voting, depending on the county. More than 100 counties have never offered voting on Sunday and many counties offered only a single day of weekend voting. Requiring two Saturday voting days and two optional Sunday voting days will dramaticall
y increase the total voting hours for voters across the State of Georgia, and all electors in Georgia will have access to multiple opportunities to vote in person on the weekend for the first time;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(6) Some counties in 2020 received significant infusions of grant funding for election operations, while other counties received no such funds. Promoting unif
ormity in the distribution of funds to election operations will boost voter confidence and ensure that there is no political advantage conferred by preferring certain counties over others in the distribution of funds;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(7) Elections in Georgia are administered by counties, but that can lead to problems for voters in counties with dysfunctional election systems. Counties with
 long-term problems of lines, problems with processing of absentee ballots, and other challenges in administration need accountability, but state officials are limited in what they are able to do to address those problems. Ensuring there is a mechanism t
o address local election problems will promote voter confidence and meet the goal of uniformity;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(8) Elections are a public process and public participation is encouraged by all involved, but the enthusiasm of some outside groups in sending multiple absen
tee ballot applications in 2020, often with incorrectly filled-in voter information, led to significant confusion by electors. Clarifying the rules regarding absentee ballot applications will build elector confidence while not sacrificing the opportuniti
es for electors to participate in the process;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(9) The lengthy absentee ballot process also led to elector confusion, including electors who were told they had already voted when they arrived to vote in pe
rson. Creating a definite period of absentee voting will assist electors in understanding the election process while also ensuring that opportunities to vote are not diminished, especially when many absentee ballots issued in the last few days before the
 election were not successfully voted or were returned late;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(10) Opportunities for delivering absentee ballots to a drop box were first created by the State Election Board as a pandemic response. The drop boxes created
 by rule no longer existed in Georgia law when the emergency rules that created them expired. The General Assembly considered a variety of options and constructed a system that allows the use of drop boxes, while also ensuring the security of the system 
and providing options in emergency situations;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(11) The lengthy nine-week runoffs in 2020 were exhausting for candidates, donors, and electors. By adding ranked choice voting for military and overseas vote
rs, the run-off period can be shortened to a more manageable period for all involved, easing the burden on election officials and on electors;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(12) Counting absentee ballots in 2020 took an incredibly long time in some counties. Creating processes for early processing and scanning of absentee ballots
 will promote elector confidence by ensuring that results are reported quickly;

 of advance voting, depending on the county. More than 100 counties have never offered voting on Sunday and many counties offered only a single day of weekend voting. Requiring two Saturday voting days and two optional Sunday voting days will dramaticall
y increase the total voting hours for voters across the State of Georgia, and all electors in Georgia will have access to multiple opportunities to vote in person on the weekend for the first time;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(6) Some counties in 2020 received significant infusions of grant funding for election operations, while other counties received no such funds. Promoting unif
ormity in the distribution of funds to election operations will boost voter confidence and ensure that there is no political advantage conferred by preferring certain counties over others in the distribution of funds;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(7) Elections in Georgia are administered by counties, but that can lead to problems for voters in counties with dysfunctional election systems. Counties with
 long-term problems of lines, problems with processing of absentee ballots, and other challenges in administration need accountability, but state officials are limited in what they are able to do to address those problems. Ensuring there is a mechanism t
o address local election problems will promote voter confidence and meet the goal of uniformity;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(8) Elections are a public process and public participation is encouraged by all involved, but the enthusiasm of some outside groups in sending multiple absen
tee ballot applications in 2020, often with incorrectly filled-in voter information, led to significant confusion by electors. Clarifying the rules regarding absentee ballot applications will build elector confidence while not sacrificing the opportuniti
es for electors to participate in the process;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(9) The lengthy absentee ballot process also led to elector confusion, including electors who were told they had already voted when they arrived to vote in pe
rson. Creating a definite period of absentee voting will assist electors in understanding the election process while also ensuring that opportunities to vote are not diminished, especially when many absentee ballots issued in the last few days before the
 election were not successfully voted or were returned late;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(10) Opportunities for delivering absentee ballots to a drop box were first created by the State Election Board as a pandemic response. The drop boxes created
 by rule no longer existed in Georgia law when the emergency rules that created them expired. The General Assembly considered a variety of options and constructed a system that allows the use of drop boxes, while also ensuring the security of the system 
and providing options in emergency situations;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(11) The lengthy nine-week runoffs in 2020 were exhausting for candidates, donors, and electors. By adding ranked choice voting for military and overseas vote
rs, the run-off period can be shortened to a more manageable period for all involved, easing the burden on election officials and on electors;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(12) Counting absentee ballots in 2020 took an incredibly long time in some counties. Creating processes for early processing and scanning of absentee ballots
 will promote elector confidence by ensuring that results are reported quickly;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(13) The sanctity of the precinct was also brought into sharp focus in 2020, with many groups approaching electors while they waited in line. Protecting elect
ors from improper interference, political pressure, or intimidation while waiting in line to vote is of paramount importance to protecting the election system and ensuring elector confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(14) Ballot duplication for provisional ballots and other purposes places a heavy burden on election officials. The number of duplicated ballots has continued
 to rise dramatically from 2016 through 2020. Reducing the number of duplicated ballots will significantly reduce the burden on election officials and creating bipartisan panels to conduct duplication will promote elector confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(15) Electors voting out of precinct add to the burden on election officials and lines for other electors because of the length of time it takes to process a 
provisional ballot in a precinct. Electors should be directed to the correct precinct on election day to ensure that they are able to vote in all elections for which they are eligible;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(16) In considering the changes in 2021, the General Assembly heard hours of testimony from electors, election officials, and attorneys involved in voting. Th
e General Assembly made significant modifications through the legislative process as it weighed the various interests involved, including adding further weekend voting, changing parameters for out-of-precinct voting, and adding transparency for ballot im
ages; and

\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(4) The changes made in this legislation in 2021 are designed to address the lack of elector confidence in the election system on all sides of the political s
pectrum, to reduce the burden on election officials, and to streamline the process of conducting elections in Georgia by promoting uniformity in voting. Several examples will help explain how these goals are achieved;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(5) The broad discretion allowed to local officials for advance voting dates and hours led to significant variations across the state in total number of hours
 of advance voting, depending on the county. More than 100 counties have never offered voting on Sunday and many counties offered only a single day of weekend voting. Requiring two Saturday voting days and two optional Sunday voting days will dramaticall
y increase the total voting hours for voters across the State of Georgia, and all electors in Georgia will have access to multiple opportunities to vote in person on the weekend for the first time;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(6) Some counties in 2020 received significant infusions of grant funding for election operations, while other counties received no such funds. Promoting unif
ormity in the distribution of funds to election operations will boost voter confidence and ensure that there is no political advantage conferred by preferring certain counties over others in the distribution of funds;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(7) Elections in Georgia are administered by counties, but that can lead to problems for voters in counties with dysfunctional election systems. Counties with
 long-term problems of lines, problems with processing of absentee ballots, and other challenges in administration need accountability, but state officials are limited in what they are able to do to address those problems. Ensuring there is a mechanism t
o address local election problems will promote voter confidence and meet the goal of uniformity;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(8) Elections are a public process and public participation is encouraged by all involved, but the enthusiasm of some outside groups in sending multiple absen
tee ballot applications in 2020, often with incorrectly filled-in voter information, led to significant confusion by electors. Clarifying the rules regarding absentee ballot applications will build elector confidence while not sacrificing the opportuniti
es for electors to participate in the process;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(9) The lengthy absentee ballot process also led to elector confusion, including electors who were told they had already voted when they arrived to vote in pe
rson. Creating a definite period of absentee voting will assist electors in understanding the election process while also ensuring that opportunities to vote are not diminished, especially when many absentee ballots issued in the last few days before the
 election were not successfully voted or were returned late;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(10) Opportunities for delivering absentee ballots to a drop box were first created by the State Election Board as a pandemic response. The drop boxes created
 by rule no longer existed in Georgia law when the emergency rules that created them expired. The General Assembly considered a variety of options and constructed a system that allows the use of drop boxes, while also ensuring the security of the system 
and providing options in emergency situations;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(11) The lengthy nine-week runoffs in 2020 were exhausting for candidates, donors, and electors. By adding ranked choice voting for military and overseas vote
rs, the run-off period can be shortened to a more manageable period for all involved, easing the burden on election officials and on electors;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(12) Counting absentee ballots in 2020 took an incredibly long time in some counties. Creating processes for early processing and scanning of absentee ballots
 will promote elector confidence by ensuring that results are reported quickly;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(13) The sanctity of the precinct was also brought into sharp focus in 2020, with many groups approaching electors while they waited in line. Protecting elect
ors from improper interference, political pressure, or intimidation while waiting in line to vote is of paramount importance to protecting the election system and ensuring elector confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(14) Ballot duplication for provisional ballots and other purposes places a heavy burden on election officials. The number of duplicated ballots has continued
 to rise dramatically from 2016 through 2020. Reducing the number of duplicated ballots will significantly reduce the burden on election officials and creating bipartisan panels to conduct duplication will promote elector confidence;

provisional ballot in a precinct. Electors should be directed to the correct precinct on election day to ensure that they are able to vote in all elections for which they are eligible;

t the general primary runoff in the same manner as prescribed in this Code section for the nonpartisan election and there shall be a separate official nonpartisan election run-off ballot for those electors who do not choose or are not eligible to vote in
 the general primary runoff. In the event that only nonpartisan candidates are to be placed on a run-off ballot, the form of the ballot shall be as prescribed by the Secretary of State or election superintendent in essentially the same format as prescrib

\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(1) Following the 2018 and 2020 elections, there was a significant lack of confidence in Georgia election systems, with many electors concerned about allegati
ons of rampant voter suppression and many electors concerned about allegations of rampant voter fraud;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(2) Many Georgia election processes were challenged in court, including the subjective signature-matching requirements, by Georgians on all sides of the polit
ical spectrum before and after the 2020 general election;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(3) The stress of the 2020 elections, with a dramatic increase in absentee-by-mail ballots and pandemic restrictions, demonstrated where there were opportunit
ies to update existing processes to reduce the burden on election officials and boost voter confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(4) The changes made in this legislation in 2021 are designed to address the lack of elector confidence in the election system on all sides of the political s
pectrum, to reduce the burden on election officials, and to streamline the process of conducting elections in Georgia by promoting uniformity in voting. Several examples will help explain how these goals are achieved;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(5) The broad discretion allowed to local officials for advance voting dates and hours led to significant variations across the state in total number of hours
 of advance voting, depending on the county. More than 100 counties have never offered voting on Sunday and many counties offered only a single day of weekend voting. Requiring two Saturday voting days and two optional Sunday voting days will dramaticall
y increase the total voting hours for voters across the State of Georgia, and all electors in Georgia will have access to multiple opportunities to vote in person on the weekend for the first time;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(6) Some counties in 2020 received significant infusions of grant funding for election operations, while other counties received no such funds. Promoting unif
ormity in the distribution of funds to election operations will boost voter confidence and ensure that there is no political advantage conferred by preferring certain counties over others in the distribution of funds;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(7) Elections in Georgia are administered by counties, but that can lead to problems for voters in counties with dysfunctional election systems. Counties with
 long-term problems of lines, problems with processing of absentee ballots, and other challenges in administration need accountability, but state officials are limited in what they are able to do to address those problems. Ensuring there is a mechanism t
o address local election problems will promote voter confidence and meet the goal of uniformity;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(8) Elections are a public process and public participation is encouraged by all involved, but the enthusiasm of some outside groups in sending multiple absen
tee ballot applications in 2020, often with incorrectly filled-in voter information, led to significant confusion by electors. Clarifying the rules regarding absentee ballot applications will build elector confidence while not sacrificing the opportuniti
es for electors to participate in the process;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(9) The lengthy absentee ballot process also led to elector confusion, including electors who were told they had already voted when they arrived to vote in pe
rson. Creating a definite period of absentee voting will assist electors in understanding the election process while also ensuring that opportunities to vote are not diminished, especially when many absentee ballots issued in the last few days before the
 election were not successfully voted or were returned late;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(10) Opportunities for delivering absentee ballots to a drop box were first created by the State Election Board as a pandemic response. The drop boxes created
 by rule no longer existed in Georgia law when the emergency rules that created them expired. The General Assembly considered a variety of options and constructed a system that allows the use of drop boxes, while also ensuring the security of the system 
and providing options in emergency situations;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(11) The lengthy nine-week runoffs in 2020 were exhausting for candidates, donors, and electors. By adding ranked choice voting for military and overseas vote
rs, the run-off period can be shortened to a more manageable period for all involved, easing the burden on election officials and on electors;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(12) Counting absentee ballots in 2020 took an incredibly long time in some counties. Creating processes for early processing and scanning of absentee ballots
 will promote elector confidence by ensuring that results are reported quickly;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(13) The sanctity of the precinct was also brought into sharp focus in 2020, with many groups approaching electors while they waited in line. Protecting elect
ors from improper interference, political pressure, or intimidation while waiting in line to vote is of paramount importance to protecting the election system and ensuring elector confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(14) Ballot duplication for provisional ballots and other purposes places a heavy burden on election officials. The number of duplicated ballots has continued
 to rise dramatically from 2016 through 2020. Reducing the number of duplicated ballots will significantly reduce the burden on election officials and creating bipartisan panels to conduct duplication will promote elector confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(15) Electors voting out of precinct add to the burden on election officials and lines for other electors because of the length of time it takes to process a 
provisional ballot in a precinct. Electors should be directed to the correct precinct on election day to ensure that they are able to vote in all elections for which they are eligible;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(16) In considering the changes in 2021, the General Assembly heard hours of testimony from electors, election officials, and attorneys involved in voting. Th
e General Assembly made significant modifications through the legislative process as it weighed the various interests involved, including adding further weekend voting, changing parameters for out-of-precinct voting, and adding transparency for ballot im
ages; and
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(17) While each of the changes in this legislation in 2021 stands alone and is severable under Code Section 1-1-3, the changes in total reflect the General As
sembly\'92s considered judgment on the changes required to Georgia\'92s election system to make it \'91easy to vote and hard to cheat,\'92 applying the lessons learned from conducting an election in the 2020 pandemic.\'94

\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(5) The broad discretion allowed to local officials for advance voting dates and hours led to significant variations across the state in total number of hours
 of advance voting, depending on the county. More than 100 counties have never offered voting on Sunday and many counties offered only a single day of weekend voting. Requiring two Saturday voting days and two optional Sunday voting days will dramaticall

 long-term problems of lines, problems with processing of absentee ballots, and other challenges in administration need accountability, but state officials are limited in what they are able to do to address those problems. Ensuring there is a mechanism t

\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(1) Following the 2018 and 2020 elections, there was a significant lack of confidence in Georgia election systems, with many electors concerned about allegati
ons of rampant voter suppression and many electors concerned about allegations of rampant voter fraud;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(2) Many Georgia election processes were challenged in court, including the subjective signature-matching requirements, by Georgians on all sides of the polit
ical spectrum before and after the 2020 general election;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(3) The stress of the 2020 elections, with a dramatic increase in absentee-by-mail ballots and pandemic restrictions, demonstrated where there were opportunit
ies to update existing processes to reduce the burden on election officials and boost voter confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(4) The changes made in this legislation in 2021 are designed to address the lack of elector confidence in the election system on all sides of the political s
pectrum, to reduce the burden on election officials, and to streamline the process of conducting elections in Georgia by promoting uniformity in voting. Several examples will help explain how these goals are achieved;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(5) The broad discretion allowed to local officials for advance voting dates and hours led to significant variations across the state in total number of hours
 of advance voting, depending on the county. More than 100 counties have never offered voting on Sunday and many counties offered only a single day of weekend voting. Requiring two Saturday voting days and two optional Sunday voting days will dramaticall
y increase the total voting hours for voters across the State of Georgia, and all electors in Georgia will have access to multiple opportunities to vote in person on the weekend for the first time;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(6) Some counties in 2020 received significant infusions of grant funding for election operations, while other counties received no such funds. Promoting unif
ormity in the distribution of funds to election operations will boost voter confidence and ensure that there is no political advantage conferred by preferring certain counties over others in the distribution of funds;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(7) Elections in Georgia are administered by counties, but that can lead to problems for voters in counties with dysfunctional election systems. Counties with
 long-term problems of lines, problems with processing of absentee ballots, and other challenges in administration need accountability, but state officials are limited in what they are able to do to address those problems. Ensuring there is a mechanism t
o address local election problems will promote voter confidence and meet the goal of uniformity;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(8) Elections are a public process and public participation is encouraged by all involved, but the enthusiasm of some outside groups in sending multiple absen
tee ballot applications in 2020, often with incorrectly filled-in voter information, led to significant confusion by electors. Clarifying the rules regarding absentee ballot applications will build elector confidence while not sacrificing the opportuniti
es for electors to participate in the process;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(9) The lengthy absentee ballot process also led to elector confusion, including electors who were told they had already voted when they arrived to vote in pe
rson. Creating a definite period of absentee voting will assist electors in understanding the election process while also ensuring that opportunities to vote are not diminished, especially when many absentee ballots issued in the last few days before the
 election were not successfully voted or were returned late;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(10) Opportunities for delivering absentee ballots to a drop box were first created by the State Election Board as a pandemic response. The drop boxes created
 by rule no longer existed in Georgia law when the emergency rules that created them expired. The General Assembly considered a variety of options and constructed a system that allows the use of drop boxes, while also ensuring the security of the system 
and providing options in emergency situations;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(11) The lengthy nine-week runoffs in 2020 were exhausting for candidates, donors, and electors. By adding ranked choice voting for military and overseas vote
rs, the run-off period can be shortened to a more manageable period for all involved, easing the burden on election officials and on electors;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(12) Counting absentee ballots in 2020 took an incredibly long time in some counties. Creating processes for early processing and scanning of absentee ballots
 will promote elector confidence by ensuring that results are reported quickly;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(13) The sanctity of the precinct was also brought into sharp focus in 2020, with many groups approaching electors while they waited in line. Protecting elect
ors from improper interference, political pressure, or intimidation while waiting in line to vote is of paramount importance to protecting the election system and ensuring elector confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(14) Ballot duplication for provisional ballots and other purposes places a heavy burden on election officials. The number of duplicated ballots has continued
 to rise dramatically from 2016 through 2020. Reducing the number of duplicated ballots will significantly reduce the burden on election officials and creating bipartisan panels to conduct duplication will promote elector confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(15) Electors voting out of precinct add to the burden on election officials and lines for other electors because of the length of time it takes to process a 
provisional ballot in a precinct. Electors should be directed to the correct precinct on election day to ensure that they are able to vote in all elections for which they are eligible;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(16) In considering the changes in 2021, the General Assembly heard hours of testimony from electors, election officials, and attorneys involved in voting. Th
e General Assembly made significant modifications through the legislative process as it weighed the various interests involved, including adding further weekend voting, changing parameters for out-of-precinct voting, and adding transparency for ballot im

 of advance voting, depending on the county. More than 100 counties have never offered voting on Sunday and many counties offered only a single day of weekend voting. Requiring two Saturday voting days and two optional Sunday voting days will dramaticall
y increase the total voting hours for voters across the State of Georgia, and all electors in Georgia will have access to multiple opportunities to vote in person on the weekend for the first time;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(6) Some counties in 2020 received significant infusions of grant funding for election operations, while other counties received no such funds. Promoting unif
ormity in the distribution of funds to election operations will boost voter confidence and ensure that there is no political advantage conferred by preferring certain counties over others in the distribution of funds;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(7) Elections in Georgia are administered by counties, but that can lead to problems for voters in counties with dysfunctional election systems. Counties with
 long-term problems of lines, problems with processing of absentee ballots, and other challenges in administration need accountability, but state officials are limited in what they are able to do to address those problems. Ensuring there is a mechanism t
o address local election problems will promote voter confidence and meet the goal of uniformity;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(8) Elections are a public process and public participation is encouraged by all involved, but the enthusiasm of some outside groups in sending multiple absen
tee ballot applications in 2020, often with incorrectly filled-in voter information, led to significant confusion by electors. Clarifying the rules regarding absentee ballot applications will build elector confidence while not sacrificing the opportuniti
es for electors to participate in the process;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(9) The lengthy absentee ballot process also led to elector confusion, including electors who were told they had already voted when they arrived to vote in pe
rson. Creating a definite period of absentee voting will assist electors in understanding the election process while also ensuring that opportunities to vote are not diminished, especially when many absentee ballots issued in the last few days before the
 election were not successfully voted or were returned late;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(10) Opportunities for delivering absentee ballots to a drop box were first created by the State Election Board as a pandemic response. The drop boxes created
 by rule no longer existed in Georgia law when the emergency rules that created them expired. The General Assembly considered a variety of options and constructed a system that allows the use of drop boxes, while also ensuring the security of the system 
and providing options in emergency situations;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(11) The lengthy nine-week runoffs in 2020 were exhausting for candidates, donors, and electors. By adding ranked choice voting for military and overseas vote
rs, the run-off period can be shortened to a more manageable period for all involved, easing the burden on election officials and on electors;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(12) Counting absentee ballots in 2020 took an incredibly long time in some counties. Creating processes for early processing and scanning of absentee ballots
 will promote elector confidence by ensuring that results are reported quickly;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(13) The sanctity of the precinct was also brought into sharp focus in 2020, with many groups approaching electors while they waited in line. Protecting elect
ors from improper interference, political pressure, or intimidation while waiting in line to vote is of paramount importance to protecting the election system and ensuring elector confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(14) Ballot duplication for provisional ballots and other purposes places a heavy burden on election officials. The number of duplicated ballots has continued
 to rise dramatically from 2016 through 2020. Reducing the number of duplicated ballots will significantly reduce the burden on election officials and creating bipartisan panels to conduct duplication will promote elector confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(15) Electors voting out of precinct add to the burden on election officials and lines for other electors because of the length of time it takes to process a 
provisional ballot in a precinct. Electors should be directed to the correct precinct on election day to ensure that they are able to vote in all elections for which they are eligible;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(16) In considering the changes in 2021, the General Assembly heard hours of testimony from electors, election officials, and attorneys involved in voting. Th
e General Assembly made significant modifications through the legislative process as it weighed the various interests involved, including adding further weekend voting, changing parameters for out-of-precinct voting, and adding transparency for ballot im
ages; and
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(17) While each of the changes in this legislation in 2021 stands alone and is severable under Code Section 1-1-3, the changes in total reflect the General As

\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(1) Following the 2018 and 2020 elections, there was a significant lack of confidence in Georgia election systems, with many electors concerned about allegati
ons of rampant voter suppression and many electors concerned about allegations of rampant voter fraud;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(2) Many Georgia election processes were challenged in court, including the subjective signature-matching requirements, by Georgians on all sides of the polit
ical spectrum before and after the 2020 general election;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(3) The stress of the 2020 elections, with a dramatic increase in absentee-by-mail ballots and pandemic restrictions, demonstrated where there were opportunit
ies to update existing processes to reduce the burden on election officials and boost voter confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(4) The changes made in this legislation in 2021 are designed to address the lack of elector confidence in the election system on all sides of the political s
pectrum, to reduce the burden on election officials, and to streamline the process of conducting elections in Georgia by promoting uniformity in voting. Several examples will help explain how these goals are achieved;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(5) The broad discretion allowed to local officials for advance voting dates and hours led to significant variations across the state in total number of hours
 of advance voting, depending on the county. More than 100 counties have never offered voting on Sunday and many counties offered only a single day of weekend voting. Requiring two Saturday voting days and two optional Sunday voting days will dramaticall
y increase the total voting hours for voters across the State of Georgia, and all electors in Georgia will have access to multiple opportunities to vote in person on the weekend for the first time;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(6) Some counties in 2020 received significant infusions of grant funding for election operations, while other counties received no such funds. Promoting unif
ormity in the distribution of funds to election operations will boost voter confidence and ensure that there is no political advantage conferred by preferring certain counties over others in the distribution of funds;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(7) Elections in Georgia are administered by counties, but that can lead to problems for voters in counties with dysfunctional election systems. Counties with
 long-term problems of lines, problems with processing of absentee ballots, and other challenges in administration need accountability, but state officials are limited in what they are able to do to address those problems. Ensuring there is a mechanism t
o address local election problems will promote voter confidence and meet the goal of uniformity;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(8) Elections are a public process and public participation is encouraged by all involved, but the enthusiasm of some outside groups in sending multiple absen
tee ballot applications in 2020, often with incorrectly filled-in voter information, led to significant confusion by electors. Clarifying the rules regarding absentee ballot applications will build elector confidence while not sacrificing the opportuniti
es for electors to participate in the process;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(9) The lengthy absentee ballot process also led to elector confusion, including electors who were told they had already voted when they arrived to vote in pe
rson. Creating a definite period of absentee voting will assist electors in understanding the election process while also ensuring that opportunities to vote are not diminished, especially when many absentee ballots issued in the last few days before the
 election were not successfully voted or were returned late;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(10) Opportunities for delivering absentee ballots to a drop box were first created by the State Election Board as a pandemic response. The drop boxes created
 by rule no longer existed in Georgia law when the emergency rules that created them expired. The General Assembly considered a variety of options and constructed a system that allows the use of drop boxes, while also ensuring the security of the system 
and providing options in emergency situations;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(11) The lengthy nine-week runoffs in 2020 were exhausting for candidates, donors, and electors. By adding ranked choice voting for military and overseas vote
rs, the run-off period can be shortened to a more manageable period for all involved, easing the burden on election officials and on electors;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(12) Counting absentee ballots in 2020 took an incredibly long time in some counties. Creating processes for early processing and scanning of absentee ballots
 will promote elector confidence by ensuring that results are reported quickly;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(13) The sanctity of the precinct was also brought into sharp focus in 2020, with many groups approaching electors while they waited in line. Protecting elect
ors from improper interference, political pressure, or intimidation while waiting in line to vote is of paramount importance to protecting the election system and ensuring elector confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(14) Ballot duplication for provisional ballots and other purposes places a heavy burden on election officials. The number of duplicated ballots has continued
 to rise dramatically from 2016 through 2020. Reducing the number of duplicated ballots will significantly reduce the burden on election officials and creating bipartisan panels to conduct duplication will promote elector confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(15) Electors voting out of precinct add to the burden on election officials and lines for other electors because of the length of time it takes to process a 
provisional ballot in a precinct. Electors should be directed to the correct precinct on election day to ensure that they are able to vote in all elections for which they are eligible;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(16) In considering the changes in 2021, the General Assembly heard hours of testimony from electors, election officials, and attorneys involved in voting. Th
e General Assembly made significant modifications through the legislative process as it weighed the various interests involved, including adding further weekend voting, changing parameters for out-of-precinct voting, and adding transparency for ballot im
ages; and
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(17) While each of the changes in this legislation in 2021 stands alone and is severable under Code Section 1-1-3, the changes in total reflect the General As

\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(1) Following the 2018 and 2020 elections, there was a significant lack of confidence in Georgia election systems, with many electors concerned about allegati
ons of rampant voter suppression and many electors concerned about allegations of rampant voter fraud;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(2) Many Georgia election processes were challenged in court, including the subjective signature-matching requirements, by Georgians on all sides of the polit
ical spectrum before and after the 2020 general election;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(3) The stress of the 2020 elections, with a dramatic increase in absentee-by-mail ballots and pandemic restrictions, demonstrated where there were opportunit
ies to update existing processes to reduce the burden on election officials and boost voter confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(4) The changes made in this legislation in 2021 are designed to address the lack of elector confidence in the election system on all sides of the political s
pectrum, to reduce the burden on election officials, and to streamline the process of conducting elections in Georgia by promoting uniformity in voting. Several examples will help explain how these goals are achieved;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(5) The broad discretion allowed to local officials for advance voting dates and hours led to significant variations across the state in total number of hours
 of advance voting, depending on the county. More than 100 counties have never offered voting on Sunday and many counties offered only a single day of weekend voting. Requiring two Saturday voting days and two optional Sunday voting days will dramaticall
y increase the total voting hours for voters across the State of Georgia, and all electors in Georgia will have access to multiple opportunities to vote in person on the weekend for the first time;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(6) Some counties in 2020 received significant infusions of grant funding for election operations, while other counties received no such funds. Promoting unif
ormity in the distribution of funds to election operations will boost voter confidence and ensure that there is no political advantage conferred by preferring certain counties over others in the distribution of funds;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(7) Elections in Georgia are administered by counties, but that can lead to problems for voters in counties with dysfunctional election systems. Counties with
 long-term problems of lines, problems with processing of absentee ballots, and other challenges in administration need accountability, but state officials are limited in what they are able to do to address those problems. Ensuring there is a mechanism t
o address local election problems will promote voter confidence and meet the goal of uniformity;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(8) Elections are a public process and public participation is encouraged by all involved, but the enthusiasm of some outside groups in sending multiple absen
tee ballot applications in 2020, often with incorrectly filled-in voter information, led to significant confusion by electors. Clarifying the rules regarding absentee ballot applications will build elector confidence while not sacrificing the opportuniti
es for electors to participate in the process;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(9) The lengthy absentee ballot process also led to elector confusion, including electors who were told they had already voted when they arrived to vote in pe
rson. Creating a definite period of absentee voting will assist electors in understanding the election process while also ensuring that opportunities to vote are not diminished, especially when many absentee ballots issued in the last few days before the
 election were not successfully voted or were returned late;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(10) Opportunities for delivering absentee ballots to a drop box were first created by the State Election Board as a pandemic response. The drop boxes created
 by rule no longer existed in Georgia law when the emergency rules that created them expired. The General Assembly considered a variety of options and constructed a system that allows the use of drop boxes, while also ensuring the security of the system 
and providing options in emergency situations;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(11) The lengthy nine-week runoffs in 2020 were exhausting for candidates, donors, and electors. By adding ranked choice voting for military and overseas vote
rs, the run-off period can be shortened to a more manageable period for all involved, easing the burden on election officials and on electors;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(12) Counting absentee ballots in 2020 took an incredibly long time in some counties. Creating processes for early processing and scanning of absentee ballots
 will promote elector confidence by ensuring that results are reported quickly;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(13) The sanctity of the precinct was also brought into sharp focus in 2020, with many groups approaching electors while they waited in line. Protecting elect
ors from improper interference, political pressure, or intimidation while waiting in line to vote is of paramount importance to protecting the election system and ensuring elector confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(14) Ballot duplication for provisional ballots and other purposes places a heavy burden on election officials. The number of duplicated ballots has continued
 to rise dramatically from 2016 through 2020. Reducing the number of duplicated ballots will significantly reduce the burden on election officials and creating bipartisan panels to conduct duplication will promote elector confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(15) Electors voting out of precinct add to the burden on election officials and lines for other electors because of the length of time it takes to process a 
provisional ballot in a precinct. Electors should be directed to the correct precinct on election day to ensure that they are able to vote in all elections for which they are eligible;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(16) In considering the changes in 2021, the General Assembly heard hours of testimony from electors, election officials, and attorneys involved in voting. Th
e General Assembly made significant modifications through the legislative process as it weighed the various interests involved, including adding further weekend voting, changing parameters for out-of-precinct voting, and adding transparency for ballot im
ages; and
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(17) While each of the changes in this legislation in 2021 stands alone and is severable under Code Section 1-1-3, the changes in total reflect the General As

\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(1) Following the 2018 and 2020 elections, there was a significant lack of confidence in Georgia election systems, with many electors concerned about allegati
ons of rampant voter suppression and many electors concerned about allegations of rampant voter fraud;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(2) Many Georgia election processes were challenged in court, including the subjective signature-matching requirements, by Georgians on all sides of the polit
ical spectrum before and after the 2020 general election;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(3) The stress of the 2020 elections, with a dramatic increase in absentee-by-mail ballots and pandemic restrictions, demonstrated where there were opportunit
ies to update existing processes to reduce the burden on election officials and boost voter confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(4) The changes made in this legislation in 2021 are designed to address the lack of elector confidence in the election system on all sides of the political s
pectrum, to reduce the burden on election officials, and to streamline the process of conducting elections in Georgia by promoting uniformity in voting. Several examples will help explain how these goals are achieved;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(5) The broad discretion allowed to local officials for advance voting dates and hours led to significant variations across the state in total number of hours
 of advance voting, depending on the county. More than 100 counties have never offered voting on Sunday and many counties offered only a single day of weekend voting. Requiring two Saturday voting days and two optional Sunday voting days will dramaticall
y increase the total voting hours for voters across the State of Georgia, and all electors in Georgia will have access to multiple opportunities to vote in person on the weekend for the first time;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(6) Some counties in 2020 received significant infusions of grant funding for election operations, while other counties received no such funds. Promoting unif
ormity in the distribution of funds to election operations will boost voter confidence and ensure that there is no political advantage conferred by preferring certain counties over others in the distribution of funds;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(7) Elections in Georgia are administered by counties, but that can lead to problems for voters in counties with dysfunctional election systems. Counties with
 long-term problems of lines, problems with processing of absentee ballots, and other challenges in administration need accountability, but state officials are limited in what they are able to do to address those problems. Ensuring there is a mechanism t
o address local election problems will promote voter confidence and meet the goal of uniformity;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(8) Elections are a public process and public participation is encouraged by all involved, but the enthusiasm of some outside groups in sending multiple absen
tee ballot applications in 2020, often with incorrectly filled-in voter information, led to significant confusion by electors. Clarifying the rules regarding absentee ballot applications will build elector confidence while not sacrificing the opportuniti
es for electors to participate in the process;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(9) The lengthy absentee ballot process also led to elector confusion, including electors who were told they had already voted when they arrived to vote in pe
rson. Creating a definite period of absentee voting will assist electors in understanding the election process while also ensuring that opportunities to vote are not diminished, especially when many absentee ballots issued in the last few days before the
 election were not successfully voted or were returned late;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(10) Opportunities for delivering absentee ballots to a drop box were first created by the State Election Board as a pandemic response. The drop boxes created
 by rule no longer existed in Georgia law when the emergency rules that created them expired. The General Assembly considered a variety of options and constructed a system that allows the use of drop boxes, while also ensuring the security of the system 
and providing options in emergency situations;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(11) The lengthy nine-week runoffs in 2020 were exhausting for candidates, donors, and electors. By adding ranked choice voting for military and overseas vote
rs, the run-off period can be shortened to a more manageable period for all involved, easing the burden on election officials and on electors;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(12) Counting absentee ballots in 2020 took an incredibly long time in some counties. Creating processes for early processing and scanning of absentee ballots
 will promote elector confidence by ensuring that results are reported quickly;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(13) The sanctity of the precinct was also brought into sharp focus in 2020, with many groups approaching electors while they waited in line. Protecting elect
ors from improper interference, political pressure, or intimidation while waiting in line to vote is of paramount importance to protecting the election system and ensuring elector confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(14) Ballot duplication for provisional ballots and other purposes places a heavy burden on election officials. The number of duplicated ballots has continued
 to rise dramatically from 2016 through 2020. Reducing the number of duplicated ballots will significantly reduce the burden on election officials and creating bipartisan panels to conduct duplication will promote elector confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(15) Electors voting out of precinct add to the burden on election officials and lines for other electors because of the length of time it takes to process a 
provisional ballot in a precinct. Electors should be directed to the correct precinct on election day to ensure that they are able to vote in all elections for which they are eligible;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(16) In considering the changes in 2021, the General Assembly heard hours of testimony from electors, election officials, and attorneys involved in voting. Th
e General Assembly made significant modifications through the legislative process as it weighed the various interests involved, including adding further weekend voting, changing parameters for out-of-precinct voting, and adding transparency for ballot im

\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(1) Following the 2018 and 2020 elections, there was a significant lack of confidence in Georgia election systems, with many electors concerned about allegati
ons of rampant voter suppression and many electors concerned about allegations of rampant voter fraud;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(2) Many Georgia election processes were challenged in court, including the subjective signature-matching requirements, by Georgians on all sides of the polit
ical spectrum before and after the 2020 general election;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(3) The stress of the 2020 elections, with a dramatic increase in absentee-by-mail ballots and pandemic restrictions, demonstrated where there were opportunit
ies to update existing processes to reduce the burden on election officials and boost voter confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(4) The changes made in this legislation in 2021 are designed to address the lack of elector confidence in the election system on all sides of the political s
pectrum, to reduce the burden on election officials, and to streamline the process of conducting elections in Georgia by promoting uniformity in voting. Several examples will help explain how these goals are achieved;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(5) The broad discretion allowed to local officials for advance voting dates and hours led to significant variations across the state in total number of hours
 of advance voting, depending on the county. More than 100 counties have never offered voting on Sunday and many counties offered only a single day of weekend voting. Requiring two Saturday voting days and two optional Sunday voting days will dramaticall
y increase the total voting hours for voters across the State of Georgia, and all electors in Georgia will have access to multiple opportunities to vote in person on the weekend for the first time;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(6) Some counties in 2020 received significant infusions of grant funding for election operations, while other counties received no such funds. Promoting unif
ormity in the distribution of funds to election operations will boost voter confidence and ensure that there is no political advantage conferred by preferring certain counties over others in the distribution of funds;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(7) Elections in Georgia are administered by counties, but that can lead to problems for voters in counties with dysfunctional election systems. Counties with
 long-term problems of lines, problems with processing of absentee ballots, and other challenges in administration need accountability, but state officials are limited in what they are able to do to address those problems. Ensuring there is a mechanism t
o address local election problems will promote voter confidence and meet the goal of uniformity;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(8) Elections are a public process and public participation is encouraged by all involved, but the enthusiasm of some outside groups in sending multiple absen
tee ballot applications in 2020, often with incorrectly filled-in voter information, led to significant confusion by electors. Clarifying the rules regarding absentee ballot applications will build elector confidence while not sacrificing the opportuniti
es for electors to participate in the process;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(9) The lengthy absentee ballot process also led to elector confusion, including electors who were told they had already voted when they arrived to vote in pe

 by rule no longer existed in Georgia law when the emergency rules that created them expired. The General Assembly considered a variety of options and constructed a system that allows the use of drop boxes, while also ensuring the security of the system

\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(1) Following the 2018 and 2020 elections, there was a significant lack of confidence in Georgia election systems, with many electors concerned about allegati
ons of rampant voter suppression and many electors concerned about allegations of rampant voter fraud;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(2) Many Georgia election processes were challenged in court, including the subjective signature-matching requirements, by Georgians on all sides of the polit
ical spectrum before and after the 2020 general election;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(3) The stress of the 2020 elections, with a dramatic increase in absentee-by-mail ballots and pandemic restrictions, demonstrated where there were opportunit
ies to update existing processes to reduce the burden on election officials and boost voter confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(4) The changes made in this legislation in 2021 are designed to address the lack of elector confidence in the election system on all sides of the political s
pectrum, to reduce the burden on election officials, and to streamline the process of conducting elections in Georgia by promoting uniformity in voting. Several examples will help explain how these goals are achieved;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(5) The broad discretion allowed to local officials for advance voting dates and hours led to significant variations across the state in total number of hours
 of advance voting, depending on the county. More than 100 counties have never offered voting on Sunday and many counties offered only a single day of weekend voting. Requiring two Saturday voting days and two optional Sunday voting days will dramaticall
y increase the total voting hours for voters across the State of Georgia, and all electors in Georgia will have access to multiple opportunities to vote in person on the weekend for the first time;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(6) Some counties in 2020 received significant infusions of grant funding for election operations, while other counties received no such funds. Promoting unif
ormity in the distribution of funds to election operations will boost voter confidence and ensure that there is no political advantage conferred by preferring certain counties over others in the distribution of funds;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(7) Elections in Georgia are administered by counties, but that can lead to problems for voters in counties with dysfunctional election systems. Counties with
 long-term problems of lines, problems with processing of absentee ballots, and other challenges in administration need accountability, but state officials are limited in what they are able to do to address those problems. Ensuring there is a mechanism t
o address local election problems will promote voter confidence and meet the goal of uniformity;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(8) Elections are a public process and public participation is encouraged by all involved, but the enthusiasm of some outside groups in sending multiple absen
tee ballot applications in 2020, often with incorrectly filled-in voter information, led to significant confusion by electors. Clarifying the rules regarding absentee ballot applications will build elector confidence while not sacrificing the opportuniti
es for electors to participate in the process;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(9) The lengthy absentee ballot process also led to elector confusion, including electors who were told they had already voted when they arrived to vote in pe
rson. Creating a definite period of absentee voting will assist electors in understanding the election process while also ensuring that opportunities to vote are not diminished, especially when many absentee ballots issued in the last few days before the
 election were not successfully voted or were returned late;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(10) Opportunities for delivering absentee ballots to a drop box were first created by the State Election Board as a pandemic response. The drop boxes created
 by rule no longer existed in Georgia law when the emergency rules that created them expired. The General Assembly considered a variety of options and constructed a system that allows the use of drop boxes, while also ensuring the security of the system 
and providing options in emergency situations;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(11) The lengthy nine-week runoffs in 2020 were exhausting for candidates, donors, and electors. By adding ranked choice voting for military and overseas vote
rs, the run-off period can be shortened to a more manageable period for all involved, easing the burden on election officials and on electors;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(12) Counting absentee ballots in 2020 took an incredibly long time in some counties. Creating processes for early processing and scanning of absentee ballots
 will promote elector confidence by ensuring that results are reported quickly;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(13) The sanctity of the precinct was also brought into sharp focus in 2020, with many groups approaching electors while they waited in line. Protecting elect
ors from improper interference, political pressure, or intimidation while waiting in line to vote is of paramount importance to protecting the election system and ensuring elector confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(14) Ballot duplication for provisional ballots and other purposes places a heavy burden on election officials. The number of duplicated ballots has continued
 to rise dramatically from 2016 through 2020. Reducing the number of duplicated ballots will significantly reduce the burden on election officials and creating bipartisan panels to conduct duplication will promote elector confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(15) Electors voting out of precinct add to the burden on election officials and lines for other electors because of the length of time it takes to process a 
provisional ballot in a precinct. Electors should be directed to the correct precinct on election day to ensure that they are able to vote in all elections for which they are eligible;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(16) In considering the changes in 2021, the General Assembly heard hours of testimony from electors, election officials, and attorneys involved in voting. Th
e General Assembly made significant modifications through the legislative process as it weighed the various interests involved, including adding further weekend voting, changing parameters for out-of-precinct voting, and adding transparency for ballot im

\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(1) Following the 2018 and 2020 elections, there was a significant lack of confidence in Georgia election systems, with many electors concerned about allegati
ons of rampant voter suppression and many electors concerned about allegations of rampant voter fraud;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(2) Many Georgia election processes were challenged in court, including the subjective signature-matching requirements, by Georgians on all sides of the polit
ical spectrum before and after the 2020 general election;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(3) The stress of the 2020 elections, with a dramatic increase in absentee-by-mail ballots and pandemic restrictions, demonstrated where there were opportunit
ies to update existing processes to reduce the burden on election officials and boost voter confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(4) The changes made in this legislation in 2021 are designed to address the lack of elector confidence in the election system on all sides of the political s
pectrum, to reduce the burden on election officials, and to streamline the process of conducting elections in Georgia by promoting uniformity in voting. Several examples will help explain how these goals are achieved;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(5) The broad discretion allowed to local officials for advance voting dates and hours led to significant variations across the state in total number of hours
 of advance voting, depending on the county. More than 100 counties have never offered voting on Sunday and many counties offered only a single day of weekend voting. Requiring two Saturday voting days and two optional Sunday voting days will dramaticall
y increase the total voting hours for voters across the State of Georgia, and all electors in Georgia will have access to multiple opportunities to vote in person on the weekend for the first time;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(6) Some counties in 2020 received significant infusions of grant funding for election operations, while other counties received no such funds. Promoting unif
ormity in the distribution of funds to election operations will boost voter confidence and ensure that there is no political advantage conferred by preferring certain counties over others in the distribution of funds;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(7) Elections in Georgia are administered by counties, but that can lead to problems for voters in counties with dysfunctional election systems. Counties with
 long-term problems of lines, problems with processing of absentee ballots, and other challenges in administration need accountability, but state officials are limited in what they are able to do to address those problems. Ensuring there is a mechanism t
o address local election problems will promote voter confidence and meet the goal of uniformity;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(8) Elections are a public process and public participation is encouraged by all involved, but the enthusiasm of some outside groups in sending multiple absen
tee ballot applications in 2020, often with incorrectly filled-in voter information, led to significant confusion by electors. Clarifying the rules regarding absentee ballot applications will build elector confidence while not sacrificing the opportuniti
es for electors to participate in the process;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(9) The lengthy absentee ballot process also led to elector confusion, including electors who were told they had already voted when they arrived to vote in pe
rson. Creating a definite period of absentee voting will assist electors in understanding the election process while also ensuring that opportunities to vote are not diminished, especially when many absentee ballots issued in the last few days before the
 election were not successfully voted or were returned late;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(10) Opportunities for delivering absentee ballots to a drop box were first created by the State Election Board as a pandemic response. The drop boxes created
 by rule no longer existed in Georgia law when the emergency rules that created them expired. The General Assembly considered a variety of options and constructed a system that allows the use of drop boxes, while also ensuring the security of the system 
and providing options in emergency situations;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(11) The lengthy nine-week runoffs in 2020 were exhausting for candidates, donors, and electors. By adding ranked choice voting for military and overseas vote
rs, the run-off period can be shortened to a more manageable period for all involved, easing the burden on election officials and on electors;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(12) Counting absentee ballots in 2020 took an incredibly long time in some counties. Creating processes for early processing and scanning of absentee ballots
 will promote elector confidence by ensuring that results are reported quickly;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(13) The sanctity of the precinct was also brought into sharp focus in 2020, with many groups approaching electors while they waited in line. Protecting elect
ors from improper interference, political pressure, or intimidation while waiting in line to vote is of paramount importance to protecting the election system and ensuring elector confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(14) Ballot duplication for provisional ballots and other purposes places a heavy burden on election officials. The number of duplicated ballots has continued
 to rise dramatically from 2016 through 2020. Reducing the number of duplicated ballots will significantly reduce the burden on election officials and creating bipartisan panels to conduct duplication will promote elector confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(15) Electors voting out of precinct add to the burden on election officials and lines for other electors because of the length of time it takes to process a 
provisional ballot in a precinct. Electors should be directed to the correct precinct on election day to ensure that they are able to vote in all elections for which they are eligible;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(16) In considering the changes in 2021, the General Assembly heard hours of testimony from electors, election officials, and attorneys involved in voting. Th
e General Assembly made significant modifications through the legislative process as it weighed the various interests involved, including adding further weekend voting, changing parameters for out-of-precinct voting, and adding transparency for ballot im
ages; and
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(17) While each of the changes in this legislation in 2021 stands alone and is severable under Code Section 1-1-3, the changes in total reflect the General As
sembly\'92s considered judgment on the changes required to Georgia\'92s election system to make it \'91easy to vote and hard to cheat,\'92 applying the lessons learned from conducting an election in the 2020 pandemic.\'94

\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(1) Following the 2018 and 2020 elections, there was a significant lack of confidence in Georgia election systems, with many electors concerned about allegati
ons of rampant voter suppression and many electors concerned about allegations of rampant voter fraud;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(2) Many Georgia election processes were challenged in court, including the subjective signature-matching requirements, by Georgians on all sides of the polit
ical spectrum before and after the 2020 general election;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(3) The stress of the 2020 elections, with a dramatic increase in absentee-by-mail ballots and pandemic restrictions, demonstrated where there were opportunit
ies to update existing processes to reduce the burden on election officials and boost voter confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(4) The changes made in this legislation in 2021 are designed to address the lack of elector confidence in the election system on all sides of the political s
pectrum, to reduce the burden on election officials, and to streamline the process of conducting elections in Georgia by promoting uniformity in voting. Several examples will help explain how these goals are achieved;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(5) The broad discretion allowed to local officials for advance voting dates and hours led to significant variations across the state in total number of hours
 of advance voting, depending on the county. More than 100 counties have never offered voting on Sunday and many counties offered only a single day of weekend voting. Requiring two Saturday voting days and two optional Sunday voting days will dramaticall
y increase the total voting hours for voters across the State of Georgia, and all electors in Georgia will have access to multiple opportunities to vote in person on the weekend for the first time;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(6) Some counties in 2020 received significant infusions of grant funding for election operations, while other counties received no such funds. Promoting unif
ormity in the distribution of funds to election operations will boost voter confidence and ensure that there is no political advantage conferred by preferring certain counties over others in the distribution of funds;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(7) Elections in Georgia are administered by counties, but that can lead to problems for voters in counties with dysfunctional election systems. Counties with
 long-term problems of lines, problems with processing of absentee ballots, and other challenges in administration need accountability, but state officials are limited in what they are able to do to address those problems. Ensuring there is a mechanism t
o address local election problems will promote voter confidence and meet the goal of uniformity;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(8) Elections are a public process and public participation is encouraged by all involved, but the enthusiasm of some outside groups in sending multiple absen
tee ballot applications in 2020, often with incorrectly filled-in voter information, led to significant confusion by electors. Clarifying the rules regarding absentee ballot applications will build elector confidence while not sacrificing the opportuniti
es for electors to participate in the process;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(9) The lengthy absentee ballot process also led to elector confusion, including electors who were told they had already voted when they arrived to vote in pe
rson. Creating a definite period of absentee voting will assist electors in understanding the election process while also ensuring that opportunities to vote are not diminished, especially when many absentee ballots issued in the last few days before the
 election were not successfully voted or were returned late;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(10) Opportunities for delivering absentee ballots to a drop box were first created by the State Election Board as a pandemic response. The drop boxes created
 by rule no longer existed in Georgia law when the emergency rules that created them expired. The General Assembly considered a variety of options and constructed a system that allows the use of drop boxes, while also ensuring the security of the system 
and providing options in emergency situations;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(11) The lengthy nine-week runoffs in 2020 were exhausting for candidates, donors, and electors. By adding ranked choice voting for military and overseas vote
rs, the run-off period can be shortened to a more manageable period for all involved, easing the burden on election officials and on electors;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(12) Counting absentee ballots in 2020 took an incredibly long time in some counties. Creating processes for early processing and scanning of absentee ballots
 will promote elector confidence by ensuring that results are reported quickly;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(13) The sanctity of the precinct was also brought into sharp focus in 2020, with many groups approaching electors while they waited in line. Protecting elect
ors from improper interference, political pressure, or intimidation while waiting in line to vote is of paramount importance to protecting the election system and ensuring elector confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(14) Ballot duplication for provisional ballots and other purposes places a heavy burden on election officials. The number of duplicated ballots has continued
 to rise dramatically from 2016 through 2020. Reducing the number of duplicated ballots will significantly reduce the burden on election officials and creating bipartisan panels to conduct duplication will promote elector confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(15) Electors voting out of precinct add to the burden on election officials and lines for other electors because of the length of time it takes to process a 
provisional ballot in a precinct. Electors should be directed to the correct precinct on election day to ensure that they are able to vote in all elections for which they are eligible;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(16) In considering the changes in 2021, the General Assembly heard hours of testimony from electors, election officials, and attorneys involved in voting. Th
e General Assembly made significant modifications through the legislative process as it weighed the various interests involved, including adding further weekend voting, changing parameters for out-of-precinct voting, and adding transparency for ballot im
ages; and
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(17) While each of the changes in this legislation in 2021 stands alone and is severable under Code Section 1-1-3, the changes in total reflect the General As

\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(1) Following the 2018 and 2020 elections, there was a significant lack of confidence in Georgia election systems, with many electors concerned about allegati
ons of rampant voter suppression and many electors concerned about allegations of rampant voter fraud;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(2) Many Georgia election processes were challenged in court, including the subjective signature-matching requirements, by Georgians on all sides of the polit
ical spectrum before and after the 2020 general election;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(3) The stress of the 2020 elections, with a dramatic increase in absentee-by-mail ballots and pandemic restrictions, demonstrated where there were opportunit
ies to update existing processes to reduce the burden on election officials and boost voter confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(4) The changes made in this legislation in 2021 are designed to address the lack of elector confidence in the election system on all sides of the political s
pectrum, to reduce the burden on election officials, and to streamline the process of conducting elections in Georgia by promoting uniformity in voting. Several examples will help explain how these goals are achieved;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(5) The broad discretion allowed to local officials for advance voting dates and hours led to significant variations across the state in total number of hours
 of advance voting, depending on the county. More than 100 counties have never offered voting on Sunday and many counties offered only a single day of weekend voting. Requiring two Saturday voting days and two optional Sunday voting days will dramaticall
y increase the total voting hours for voters across the State of Georgia, and all electors in Georgia will have access to multiple opportunities to vote in person on the weekend for the first time;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(6) Some counties in 2020 received significant infusions of grant funding for election operations, while other counties received no such funds. Promoting unif
ormity in the distribution of funds to election operations will boost voter confidence and ensure that there is no political advantage conferred by preferring certain counties over others in the distribution of funds;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(7) Elections in Georgia are administered by counties, but that can lead to problems for voters in counties with dysfunctional election systems. Counties with
 long-term problems of lines, problems with processing of absentee ballots, and other challenges in administration need accountability, but state officials are limited in what they are able to do to address those problems. Ensuring there is a mechanism t
o address local election problems will promote voter confidence and meet the goal of uniformity;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(8) Elections are a public process and public participation is encouraged by all involved, but the enthusiasm of some outside groups in sending multiple absen
tee ballot applications in 2020, often with incorrectly filled-in voter information, led to significant confusion by electors. Clarifying the rules regarding absentee ballot applications will build elector confidence while not sacrificing the opportuniti
es for electors to participate in the process;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(9) The lengthy absentee ballot process also led to elector confusion, including electors who were told they had already voted when they arrived to vote in pe
rson. Creating a definite period of absentee voting will assist electors in understanding the election process while also ensuring that opportunities to vote are not diminished, especially when many absentee ballots issued in the last few days before the
 election were not successfully voted or were returned late;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(10) Opportunities for delivering absentee ballots to a drop box were first created by the State Election Board as a pandemic response. The drop boxes created
 by rule no longer existed in Georgia law when the emergency rules that created them expired. The General Assembly considered a variety of options and constructed a system that allows the use of drop boxes, while also ensuring the security of the system 
and providing options in emergency situations;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(11) The lengthy nine-week runoffs in 2020 were exhausting for candidates, donors, and electors. By adding ranked choice voting for military and overseas vote
rs, the run-off period can be shortened to a more manageable period for all involved, easing the burden on election officials and on electors;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(12) Counting absentee ballots in 2020 took an incredibly long time in some counties. Creating processes for early processing and scanning of absentee ballots
 will promote elector confidence by ensuring that results are reported quickly;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(13) The sanctity of the precinct was also brought into sharp focus in 2020, with many groups approaching electors while they waited in line. Protecting elect
ors from improper interference, political pressure, or intimidation while waiting in line to vote is of paramount importance to protecting the election system and ensuring elector confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(14) Ballot duplication for provisional ballots and other purposes places a heavy burden on election officials. The number of duplicated ballots has continued
 to rise dramatically from 2016 through 2020. Reducing the number of duplicated ballots will significantly reduce the burden on election officials and creating bipartisan panels to conduct duplication will promote elector confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(15) Electors voting out of precinct add to the burden on election officials and lines for other electors because of the length of time it takes to process a 
provisional ballot in a precinct. Electors should be directed to the correct precinct on election day to ensure that they are able to vote in all elections for which they are eligible;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(16) In considering the changes in 2021, the General Assembly heard hours of testimony from electors, election officials, and attorneys involved in voting. Th
e General Assembly made significant modifications through the legislative process as it weighed the various interests involved, including adding further weekend voting, changing parameters for out-of-precinct voting, and adding transparency for ballot im

\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(1) Following the 2018 and 2020 elections, there was a significant lack of confidence in Georgia election systems, with many electors concerned about allegati
ons of rampant voter suppression and many electors concerned about allegations of rampant voter fraud;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(2) Many Georgia election processes were challenged in court, including the subjective signature-matching requirements, by Georgians on all sides of the polit
ical spectrum before and after the 2020 general election;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(3) The stress of the 2020 elections, with a dramatic increase in absentee-by-mail ballots and pandemic restrictions, demonstrated where there were opportunit
ies to update existing processes to reduce the burden on election officials and boost voter confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(4) The changes made in this legislation in 2021 are designed to address the lack of elector confidence in the election system on all sides of the political s
pectrum, to reduce the burden on election officials, and to streamline the process of conducting elections in Georgia by promoting uniformity in voting. Several examples will help explain how these goals are achieved;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(5) The broad discretion allowed to local officials for advance voting dates and hours led to significant variations across the state in total number of hours
 of advance voting, depending on the county. More than 100 counties have never offered voting on Sunday and many counties offered only a single day of weekend voting. Requiring two Saturday voting days and two optional Sunday voting days will dramaticall
y increase the total voting hours for voters across the State of Georgia, and all electors in Georgia will have access to multiple opportunities to vote in person on the weekend for the first time;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(6) Some counties in 2020 received significant infusions of grant funding for election operations, while other counties received no such funds. Promoting unif
ormity in the distribution of funds to election operations will boost voter confidence and ensure that there is no political advantage conferred by preferring certain counties over others in the distribution of funds;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(7) Elections in Georgia are administered by counties, but that can lead to problems for voters in counties with dysfunctional election systems. Counties with
 long-term problems of lines, problems with processing of absentee ballots, and other challenges in administration need accountability, but state officials are limited in what they are able to do to address those problems. Ensuring there is a mechanism t
o address local election problems will promote voter confidence and meet the goal of uniformity;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(8) Elections are a public process and public participation is encouraged by all involved, but the enthusiasm of some outside groups in sending multiple absen
tee ballot applications in 2020, often with incorrectly filled-in voter information, led to significant confusion by electors. Clarifying the rules regarding absentee ballot applications will build elector confidence while not sacrificing the opportuniti
es for electors to participate in the process;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(9) The lengthy absentee ballot process also led to elector confusion, including electors who were told they had already voted when they arrived to vote in pe
rson. Creating a definite period of absentee voting will assist electors in understanding the election process while also ensuring that opportunities to vote are not diminished, especially when many absentee ballots issued in the last few days before the
 election were not successfully voted or were returned late;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(10) Opportunities for delivering absentee ballots to a drop box were first created by the State Election Board as a pandemic response. The drop boxes created
 by rule no longer existed in Georgia law when the emergency rules that created them expired. The General Assembly considered a variety of options and constructed a system that allows the use of drop boxes, while also ensuring the security of the system 
and providing options in emergency situations;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(11) The lengthy nine-week runoffs in 2020 were exhausting for candidates, donors, and electors. By adding ranked choice voting for military and overseas vote
rs, the run-off period can be shortened to a more manageable period for all involved, easing the burden on election officials and on electors;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(12) Counting absentee ballots in 2020 took an incredibly long time in some counties. Creating processes for early processing and scanning of absentee ballots
 will promote elector confidence by ensuring that results are reported quickly;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(13) The sanctity of the precinct was also brought into sharp focus in 2020, with many groups approaching electors while they waited in line. Protecting elect
ors from improper interference, political pressure, or intimidation while waiting in line to vote is of paramount importance to protecting the election system and ensuring elector confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(14) Ballot duplication for provisional ballots and other purposes places a heavy burden on election officials. The number of duplicated ballots has continued

\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(1) Following the 2018 and 2020 elections, there was a significant lack of confidence in Georgia election systems, with many electors concerned about allegati
ons of rampant voter suppression and many electors concerned about allegations of rampant voter fraud;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(2) Many Georgia election processes were challenged in court, including the subjective signature-matching requirements, by Georgians on all sides of the polit
ical spectrum before and after the 2020 general election;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(3) The stress of the 2020 elections, with a dramatic increase in absentee-by-mail ballots and pandemic restrictions, demonstrated where there were opportunit
ies to update existing processes to reduce the burden on election officials and boost voter confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(4) The changes made in this legislation in 2021 are designed to address the lack of elector confidence in the election system on all sides of the political s
pectrum, to reduce the burden on election officials, and to streamline the process of conducting elections in Georgia by promoting uniformity in voting. Several examples will help explain how these goals are achieved;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(5) The broad discretion allowed to local officials for advance voting dates and hours led to significant variations across the state in total number of hours
 of advance voting, depending on the county. More than 100 counties have never offered voting on Sunday and many counties offered only a single day of weekend voting. Requiring two Saturday voting days and two optional Sunday voting days will dramaticall
y increase the total voting hours for voters across the State of Georgia, and all electors in Georgia will have access to multiple opportunities to vote in person on the weekend for the first time;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(6) Some counties in 2020 received significant infusions of grant funding for election operations, while other counties received no such funds. Promoting unif
ormity in the distribution of funds to election operations will boost voter confidence and ensure that there is no political advantage conferred by preferring certain counties over others in the distribution of funds;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(7) Elections in Georgia are administered by counties, but that can lead to problems for voters in counties with dysfunctional election systems. Counties with
 long-term problems of lines, problems with processing of absentee ballots, and other challenges in administration need accountability, but state officials are limited in what they are able to do to address those problems. Ensuring there is a mechanism t
o address local election problems will promote voter confidence and meet the goal of uniformity;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(8) Elections are a public process and public participation is encouraged by all involved, but the enthusiasm of some outside groups in sending multiple absen
tee ballot applications in 2020, often with incorrectly filled-in voter information, led to significant confusion by electors. Clarifying the rules regarding absentee ballot applications will build elector confidence while not sacrificing the opportuniti
es for electors to participate in the process;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(9) The lengthy absentee ballot process also led to elector confusion, including electors who were told they had already voted when they arrived to vote in pe
rson. Creating a definite period of absentee voting will assist electors in understanding the election process while also ensuring that opportunities to vote are not diminished, especially when many absentee ballots issued in the last few days before the
 election were not successfully voted or were returned late;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(10) Opportunities for delivering absentee ballots to a drop box were first created by the State Election Board as a pandemic response. The drop boxes created
 by rule no longer existed in Georgia law when the emergency rules that created them expired. The General Assembly considered a variety of options and constructed a system that allows the use of drop boxes, while also ensuring the security of the system 
and providing options in emergency situations;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(11) The lengthy nine-week runoffs in 2020 were exhausting for candidates, donors, and electors. By adding ranked choice voting for military and overseas vote
rs, the run-off period can be shortened to a more manageable period for all involved, easing the burden on election officials and on electors;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(12) Counting absentee ballots in 2020 took an incredibly long time in some counties. Creating processes for early processing and scanning of absentee ballots
 will promote elector confidence by ensuring that results are reported quickly;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(13) The sanctity of the precinct was also brought into sharp focus in 2020, with many groups approaching electors while they waited in line. Protecting elect
ors from improper interference, political pressure, or intimidation while waiting in line to vote is of paramount importance to protecting the election system and ensuring elector confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(14) Ballot duplication for provisional ballots and other purposes places a heavy burden on election officials. The number of duplicated ballots has continued
 to rise dramatically from 2016 through 2020. Reducing the number of duplicated ballots will significantly reduce the burden on election officials and creating bipartisan panels to conduct duplication will promote elector confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(15) Electors voting out of precinct add to the burden on election officials and lines for other electors because of the length of time it takes to process a 
provisional ballot in a precinct. Electors should be directed to the correct precinct on election day to ensure that they are able to vote in all elections for which they are eligible;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(16) In considering the changes in 2021, the General Assembly heard hours of testimony from electors, election officials, and attorneys involved in voting. Th
e General Assembly made significant modifications through the legislative process as it weighed the various interests involved, including adding further weekend voting, changing parameters for out-of-precinct voting, and adding transparency for ballot im

\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(1) Following the 2018 and 2020 elections, there was a significant lack of confidence in Georgia election systems, with many electors concerned about allegati
ons of rampant voter suppression and many electors concerned about allegations of rampant voter fraud;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(2) Many Georgia election processes were challenged in court, including the subjective signature-matching requirements, by Georgians on all sides of the polit
ical spectrum before and after the 2020 general election;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(3) The stress of the 2020 elections, with a dramatic increase in absentee-by-mail ballots and pandemic restrictions, demonstrated where there were opportunit
ies to update existing processes to reduce the burden on election officials and boost voter confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(4) The changes made in this legislation in 2021 are designed to address the lack of elector confidence in the election system on all sides of the political s
pectrum, to reduce the burden on election officials, and to streamline the process of conducting elections in Georgia by promoting uniformity in voting. Several examples will help explain how these goals are achieved;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(5) The broad discretion allowed to local officials for advance voting dates and hours led to significant variations across the state in total number of hours
 of advance voting, depending on the county. More than 100 counties have never offered voting on Sunday and many counties offered only a single day of weekend voting. Requiring two Saturday voting days and two optional Sunday voting days will dramaticall
y increase the total voting hours for voters across the State of Georgia, and all electors in Georgia will have access to multiple opportunities to vote in person on the weekend for the first time;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(6) Some counties in 2020 received significant infusions of grant funding for election operations, while other counties received no such funds. Promoting unif
ormity in the distribution of funds to election operations will boost voter confidence and ensure that there is no political advantage conferred by preferring certain counties over others in the distribution of funds;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(7) Elections in Georgia are administered by counties, but that can lead to problems for voters in counties with dysfunctional election systems. Counties with
 long-term problems of lines, problems with processing of absentee ballots, and other challenges in administration need accountability, but state officials are limited in what they are able to do to address those problems. Ensuring there is a mechanism t
o address local election problems will promote voter confidence and meet the goal of uniformity;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(8) Elections are a public process and public participation is encouraged by all involved, but the enthusiasm of some outside groups in sending multiple absen
tee ballot applications in 2020, often with incorrectly filled-in voter information, led to significant confusion by electors. Clarifying the rules regarding absentee ballot applications will build elector confidence while not sacrificing the opportuniti
es for electors to participate in the process;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(9) The lengthy absentee ballot process also led to elector confusion, including electors who were told they had already voted when they arrived to vote in pe
rson. Creating a definite period of absentee voting will assist electors in understanding the election process while also ensuring that opportunities to vote are not diminished, especially when many absentee ballots issued in the last few days before the
 election were not successfully voted or were returned late;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(10) Opportunities for delivering absentee ballots to a drop box were first created by the State Election Board as a pandemic response. The drop boxes created
 by rule no longer existed in Georgia law when the emergency rules that created them expired. The General Assembly considered a variety of options and constructed a system that allows the use of drop boxes, while also ensuring the security of the system 
and providing options in emergency situations;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(11) The lengthy nine-week runoffs in 2020 were exhausting for candidates, donors, and electors. By adding ranked choice voting for military and overseas vote
rs, the run-off period can be shortened to a more manageable period for all involved, easing the burden on election officials and on electors;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(12) Counting absentee ballots in 2020 took an incredibly long time in some counties. Creating processes for early processing and scanning of absentee ballots
 will promote elector confidence by ensuring that results are reported quickly;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(13) The sanctity of the precinct was also brought into sharp focus in 2020, with many groups approaching electors while they waited in line. Protecting elect
ors from improper interference, political pressure, or intimidation while waiting in line to vote is of paramount importance to protecting the election system and ensuring elector confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(14) Ballot duplication for provisional ballots and other purposes places a heavy burden on election officials. The number of duplicated ballots has continued
 to rise dramatically from 2016 through 2020. Reducing the number of duplicated ballots will significantly reduce the burden on election officials and creating bipartisan panels to conduct duplication will promote elector confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(15) Electors voting out of precinct add to the burden on election officials and lines for other electors because of the length of time it takes to process a 
provisional ballot in a precinct. Electors should be directed to the correct precinct on election day to ensure that they are able to vote in all elections for which they are eligible;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(16) In considering the changes in 2021, the General Assembly heard hours of testimony from electors, election officials, and attorneys involved in voting. Th
e General Assembly made significant modifications through the legislative process as it weighed the various interests involved, including adding further weekend voting, changing parameters for out-of-precinct voting, and adding transparency for ballot im
ages; and
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(17) While each of the changes in this legislation in 2021 stands alone and is severable under Code Section 1-1-3, the changes in total reflect the General As

\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(1) Following the 2018 and 2020 elections, there was a significant lack of confidence in Georgia election systems, with many electors concerned about allegati
ons of rampant voter suppression and many electors concerned about allegations of rampant voter fraud;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(2) Many Georgia election processes were challenged in court, including the subjective signature-matching requirements, by Georgians on all sides of the polit
ical spectrum before and after the 2020 general election;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(3) The stress of the 2020 elections, with a dramatic increase in absentee-by-mail ballots and pandemic restrictions, demonstrated where there were opportunit
ies to update existing processes to reduce the burden on election officials and boost voter confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(4) The changes made in this legislation in 2021 are designed to address the lack of elector confidence in the election system on all sides of the political s
pectrum, to reduce the burden on election officials, and to streamline the process of conducting elections in Georgia by promoting uniformity in voting. Several examples will help explain how these goals are achieved;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(5) The broad discretion allowed to local officials for advance voting dates and hours led to significant variations across the state in total number of hours
 of advance voting, depending on the county. More than 100 counties have never offered voting on Sunday and many counties offered only a single day of weekend voting. Requiring two Saturday voting days and two optional Sunday voting days will dramaticall
y increase the total voting hours for voters across the State of Georgia, and all electors in Georgia will have access to multiple opportunities to vote in person on the weekend for the first time;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(6) Some counties in 2020 received significant infusions of grant funding for election operations, while other counties received no such funds. Promoting unif
ormity in the distribution of funds to election operations will boost voter confidence and ensure that there is no political advantage conferred by preferring certain counties over others in the distribution of funds;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(7) Elections in Georgia are administered by counties, but that can lead to problems for voters in counties with dysfunctional election systems. Counties with
 long-term problems of lines, problems with processing of absentee ballots, and other challenges in administration need accountability, but state officials are limited in what they are able to do to address those problems. Ensuring there is a mechanism t
o address local election problems will promote voter confidence and meet the goal of uniformity;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(8) Elections are a public process and public participation is encouraged by all involved, but the enthusiasm of some outside groups in sending multiple absen
tee ballot applications in 2020, often with incorrectly filled-in voter information, led to significant confusion by electors. Clarifying the rules regarding absentee ballot applications will build elector confidence while not sacrificing the opportuniti
es for electors to participate in the process;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(9) The lengthy absentee ballot process also led to elector confusion, including electors who were told they had already voted when they arrived to vote in pe
rson. Creating a definite period of absentee voting will assist electors in understanding the election process while also ensuring that opportunities to vote are not diminished, especially when many absentee ballots issued in the last few days before the
 election were not successfully voted or were returned late;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(10) Opportunities for delivering absentee ballots to a drop box were first created by the State Election Board as a pandemic response. The drop boxes created
 by rule no longer existed in Georgia law when the emergency rules that created them expired. The General Assembly considered a variety of options and constructed a system that allows the use of drop boxes, while also ensuring the security of the system 
and providing options in emergency situations;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(11) The lengthy nine-week runoffs in 2020 were exhausting for candidates, donors, and electors. By adding ranked choice voting for military and overseas vote
rs, the run-off period can be shortened to a more manageable period for all involved, easing the burden on election officials and on electors;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(12) Counting absentee ballots in 2020 took an incredibly long time in some counties. Creating processes for early processing and scanning of absentee ballots
 will promote elector confidence by ensuring that results are reported quickly;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(13) The sanctity of the precinct was also brought into sharp focus in 2020, with many groups approaching electors while they waited in line. Protecting elect
ors from improper interference, political pressure, or intimidation while waiting in line to vote is of paramount importance to protecting the election system and ensuring elector confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(14) Ballot duplication for provisional ballots and other purposes places a heavy burden on election officials. The number of duplicated ballots has continued
 to rise dramatically from 2016 through 2020. Reducing the number of duplicated ballots will significantly reduce the burden on election officials and creating bipartisan panels to conduct duplication will promote elector confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(15) Electors voting out of precinct add to the burden on election officials and lines for other electors because of the length of time it takes to process a 
provisional ballot in a precinct. Electors should be directed to the correct precinct on election day to ensure that they are able to vote in all elections for which they are eligible;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(16) In considering the changes in 2021, the General Assembly heard hours of testimony from electors, election officials, and attorneys involved in voting. Th
e General Assembly made significant modifications through the legislative process as it weighed the various interests involved, including adding further weekend voting, changing parameters for out-of-precinct voting, and adding transparency for ballot im
ages; and

\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(1) Following the 2018 and 2020 elections, there was a significant lack of confidence in Georgia election systems, with many electors concerned about allegati
ons of rampant voter suppression and many electors concerned about allegations of rampant voter fraud;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(2) Many Georgia election processes were challenged in court, including the subjective signature-matching requirements, by Georgians on all sides of the polit
ical spectrum before and after the 2020 general election;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(3) The stress of the 2020 elections, with a dramatic increase in absentee-by-mail ballots and pandemic restrictions, demonstrated where there were opportunit
ies to update existing processes to reduce the burden on election officials and boost voter confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(4) The changes made in this legislation in 2021 are designed to address the lack of elector confidence in the election system on all sides of the political s
pectrum, to reduce the burden on election officials, and to streamline the process of conducting elections in Georgia by promoting uniformity in voting. Several examples will help explain how these goals are achieved;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(5) The broad discretion allowed to local officials for advance voting dates and hours led to significant variations across the state in total number of hours
 of advance voting, depending on the county. More than 100 counties have never offered voting on Sunday and many counties offered only a single day of weekend voting. Requiring two Saturday voting days and two optional Sunday voting days will dramaticall
y increase the total voting hours for voters across the State of Georgia, and all electors in Georgia will have access to multiple opportunities to vote in person on the weekend for the first time;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(6) Some counties in 2020 received significant infusions of grant funding for election operations, while other counties received no such funds. Promoting unif
ormity in the distribution of funds to election operations will boost voter confidence and ensure that there is no political advantage conferred by preferring certain counties over others in the distribution of funds;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(7) Elections in Georgia are administered by counties, but that can lead to problems for voters in counties with dysfunctional election systems. Counties with
 long-term problems of lines, problems with processing of absentee ballots, and other challenges in administration need accountability, but state officials are limited in what they are able to do to address those problems. Ensuring there is a mechanism t
o address local election problems will promote voter confidence and meet the goal of uniformity;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(8) Elections are a public process and public participation is encouraged by all involved, but the enthusiasm of some outside groups in sending multiple absen
tee ballot applications in 2020, often with incorrectly filled-in voter information, led to significant confusion by electors. Clarifying the rules regarding absentee ballot applications will build elector confidence while not sacrificing the opportuniti
es for electors to participate in the process;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(9) The lengthy absentee ballot process also led to elector confusion, including electors who were told they had already voted when they arrived to vote in pe
rson. Creating a definite period of absentee voting will assist electors in understanding the election process while also ensuring that opportunities to vote are not diminished, especially when many absentee ballots issued in the last few days before the
 election were not successfully voted or were returned late;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(10) Opportunities for delivering absentee ballots to a drop box were first created by the State Election Board as a pandemic response. The drop boxes created
 by rule no longer existed in Georgia law when the emergency rules that created them expired. The General Assembly considered a variety of options and constructed a system that allows the use of drop boxes, while also ensuring the security of the system 
and providing options in emergency situations;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(11) The lengthy nine-week runoffs in 2020 were exhausting for candidates, donors, and electors. By adding ranked choice voting for military and overseas vote
rs, the run-off period can be shortened to a more manageable period for all involved, easing the burden on election officials and on electors;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(12) Counting absentee ballots in 2020 took an incredibly long time in some counties. Creating processes for early processing and scanning of absentee ballots
 will promote elector confidence by ensuring that results are reported quickly;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(13) The sanctity of the precinct was also brought into sharp focus in 2020, with many groups approaching electors while they waited in line. Protecting elect
ors from improper interference, political pressure, or intimidation while waiting in line to vote is of paramount importance to protecting the election system and ensuring elector confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(14) Ballot duplication for provisional ballots and other purposes places a heavy burden on election officials. The number of duplicated ballots has continued
 to rise dramatically from 2016 through 2020. Reducing the number of duplicated ballots will significantly reduce the burden on election officials and creating bipartisan panels to conduct duplication will promote elector confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(15) Electors voting out of precinct add to the burden on election officials and lines for other electors because of the length of time it takes to process a 
provisional ballot in a precinct. Electors should be directed to the correct precinct on election day to ensure that they are able to vote in all elections for which they are eligible;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(16) In considering the changes in 2021, the General Assembly heard hours of testimony from electors, election officials, and attorneys involved in voting. Th
e General Assembly made significant modifications through the legislative process as it weighed the various interests involved, including adding further weekend voting, changing parameters for out-of-precinct voting, and adding transparency for ballot im
ages; and

pectrum, to reduce the burden on election officials, and to streamline the process of conducting elections in Georgia by promoting uniformity in voting. Several examples will help explain how these goals are achieved;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(5) The broad discretion allowed to local officials for advance voting dates and hours led to significant variations across the state in total number of hours
 of advance voting, depending on the county. More than 100 counties have never offered voting on Sunday and many counties offered only a single day of weekend voting. Requiring two Saturday voting days and two optional Sunday voting days will dramaticall
y increase the total voting hours for voters across the State of Georgia, and all electors in Georgia will have access to multiple opportunities to vote in person on the weekend for the first time;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(6) Some counties in 2020 received significant infusions of grant funding for election operations, while other counties received no such funds. Promoting unif
ormity in the distribution of funds to election operations will boost voter confidence and ensure that there is no political advantage conferred by preferring certain counties over others in the distribution of funds;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(7) Elections in Georgia are administered by counties, but that can lead to problems for voters in counties with dysfunctional election systems. Counties with
 long-term problems of lines, problems with processing of absentee ballots, and other challenges in administration need accountability, but state officials are limited in what they are able to do to address those problems. Ensuring there is a mechanism t
o address local election problems will promote voter confidence and meet the goal of uniformity;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(8) Elections are a public process and public participation is encouraged by all involved, but the enthusiasm of some outside groups in sending multiple absen
tee ballot applications in 2020, often with incorrectly filled-in voter information, led to significant confusion by electors. Clarifying the rules regarding absentee ballot applications will build elector confidence while not sacrificing the opportuniti
es for electors to participate in the process;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(9) The lengthy absentee ballot process also led to elector confusion, including electors who were told they had already voted when they arrived to vote in pe
rson. Creating a definite period of absentee voting will assist electors in understanding the election process while also ensuring that opportunities to vote are not diminished, especially when many absentee ballots issued in the last few days before the
 election were not successfully voted or were returned late;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(10) Opportunities for delivering absentee ballots to a drop box were first created by the State Election Board as a pandemic response. The drop boxes created
 by rule no longer existed in Georgia law when the emergency rules that created them expired. The General Assembly considered a variety of options and constructed a system that allows the use of drop boxes, while also ensuring the security of the system 
and providing options in emergency situations;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(11) The lengthy nine-week runoffs in 2020 were exhausting for candidates, donors, and electors. By adding ranked choice voting for military and overseas vote
rs, the run-off period can be shortened to a more manageable period for all involved, easing the burden on election officials and on electors;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(12) Counting absentee ballots in 2020 took an incredibly long time in some counties. Creating processes for early processing and scanning of absentee ballots
 will promote elector confidence by ensuring that results are reported quickly;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(13) The sanctity of the precinct was also brought into sharp focus in 2020, with many groups approaching electors while they waited in line. Protecting elect
ors from improper interference, political pressure, or intimidation while waiting in line to vote is of paramount importance to protecting the election system and ensuring elector confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(14) Ballot duplication for provisional ballots and other purposes places a heavy burden on election officials. The number of duplicated ballots has continued
 to rise dramatically from 2016 through 2020. Reducing the number of duplicated ballots will significantly reduce the burden on election officials and creating bipartisan panels to conduct duplication will promote elector confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(15) Electors voting out of precinct add to the burden on election officials and lines for other electors because of the length of time it takes to process a 
provisional ballot in a precinct. Electors should be directed to the correct precinct on election day to ensure that they are able to vote in all elections for which they are eligible;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(16) In considering the changes in 2021, the General Assembly heard hours of testimony from electors, election officials, and attorneys involved in voting. Th

\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(4) The changes made in this legislation in 2021 are designed to address the lack of elector confidence in the election system on all sides of the political s
pectrum, to reduce the burden on election officials, and to streamline the process of conducting elections in Georgia by promoting uniformity in voting. Several examples will help explain how these goals are achieved;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(5) The broad discretion allowed to local officials for advance voting dates and hours led to significant variations across the state in total number of hours
 of advance voting, depending on the county. More than 100 counties have never offered voting on Sunday and many counties offered only a single day of weekend voting. Requiring two Saturday voting days and two optional Sunday voting days will dramaticall
y increase the total voting hours for voters across the State of Georgia, and all electors in Georgia will have access to multiple opportunities to vote in person on the weekend for the first time;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(6) Some counties in 2020 received significant infusions of grant funding for election operations, while other counties received no such funds. Promoting unif
ormity in the distribution of funds to election operations will boost voter confidence and ensure that there is no political advantage conferred by preferring certain counties over others in the distribution of funds;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(7) Elections in Georgia are administered by counties, but that can lead to problems for voters in counties with dysfunctional election systems. Counties with
 long-term problems of lines, problems with processing of absentee ballots, and other challenges in administration need accountability, but state officials are limited in what they are able to do to address those problems. Ensuring there is a mechanism t
o address local election problems will promote voter confidence and meet the goal of uniformity;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(8) Elections are a public process and public participation is encouraged by all involved, but the enthusiasm of some outside groups in sending multiple absen
tee ballot applications in 2020, often with incorrectly filled-in voter information, led to significant confusion by electors. Clarifying the rules regarding absentee ballot applications will build elector confidence while not sacrificing the opportuniti
es for electors to participate in the process;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(9) The lengthy absentee ballot process also led to elector confusion, including electors who were told they had already voted when they arrived to vote in pe
rson. Creating a definite period of absentee voting will assist electors in understanding the election process while also ensuring that opportunities to vote are not diminished, especially when many absentee ballots issued in the last few days before the
 election were not successfully voted or were returned late;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(10) Opportunities for delivering absentee ballots to a drop box were first created by the State Election Board as a pandemic response. The drop boxes created
 by rule no longer existed in Georgia law when the emergency rules that created them expired. The General Assembly considered a variety of options and constructed a system that allows the use of drop boxes, while also ensuring the security of the system 
and providing options in emergency situations;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(11) The lengthy nine-week runoffs in 2020 were exhausting for candidates, donors, and electors. By adding ranked choice voting for military and overseas vote
rs, the run-off period can be shortened to a more manageable period for all involved, easing the burden on election officials and on electors;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(12) Counting absentee ballots in 2020 took an incredibly long time in some counties. Creating processes for early processing and scanning of absentee ballots
 will promote elector confidence by ensuring that results are reported quickly;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(13) The sanctity of the precinct was also brought into sharp focus in 2020, with many groups approaching electors while they waited in line. Protecting elect
ors from improper interference, political pressure, or intimidation while waiting in line to vote is of paramount importance to protecting the election system and ensuring elector confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(14) Ballot duplication for provisional ballots and other purposes places a heavy burden on election officials. The number of duplicated ballots has continued
 to rise dramatically from 2016 through 2020. Reducing the number of duplicated ballots will significantly reduce the burden on election officials and creating bipartisan panels to conduct duplication will promote elector confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(15) Electors voting out of precinct add to the burden on election officials and lines for other electors because of the length of time it takes to process a 
provisional ballot in a precinct. Electors should be directed to the correct precinct on election day to ensure that they are able to vote in all elections for which they are eligible;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(16) In considering the changes in 2021, the General Assembly heard hours of testimony from electors, election officials, and attorneys involved in voting. Th
e General Assembly made significant modifications through the legislative process as it weighed the various interests involved, including adding further weekend voting, changing parameters for out-of-precinct voting, and adding transparency for ballot im

rson. Creating a definite period of absentee voting will assist electors in understanding the election process while also ensuring that opportunities to vote are not diminished, especially when many absentee ballots issued in the last few days before the
 election were not successfully voted or were returned late;

 by rule no longer existed in Georgia law when the emergency rules that created them expired. The General Assembly considered a variety of options and constructed a system that allows the use of drop boxes, while also ensuring the security of the system

\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(1) Following the 2018 and 2020 elections, there was a significant lack of confidence in Georgia election systems, with many electors concerned about allegati
ons of rampant voter suppression and many electors concerned about allegations of rampant voter fraud;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(2) Many Georgia election processes were challenged in court, including the subjective signature-matching requirements, by Georgians on all sides of the polit
ical spectrum before and after the 2020 general election;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(3) The stress of the 2020 elections, with a dramatic increase in absentee-by-mail ballots and pandemic restrictions, demonstrated where there were opportunit
ies to update existing processes to reduce the burden on election officials and boost voter confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(4) The changes made in this legislation in 2021 are designed to address the lack of elector confidence in the election system on all sides of the political s
pectrum, to reduce the burden on election officials, and to streamline the process of conducting elections in Georgia by promoting uniformity in voting. Several examples will help explain how these goals are achieved;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(5) The broad discretion allowed to local officials for advance voting dates and hours led to significant variations across the state in total number of hours
 of advance voting, depending on the county. More than 100 counties have never offered voting on Sunday and many counties offered only a single day of weekend voting. Requiring two Saturday voting days and two optional Sunday voting days will dramaticall
y increase the total voting hours for voters across the State of Georgia, and all electors in Georgia will have access to multiple opportunities to vote in person on the weekend for the first time;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(6) Some counties in 2020 received significant infusions of grant funding for election operations, while other counties received no such funds. Promoting unif
ormity in the distribution of funds to election operations will boost voter confidence and ensure that there is no political advantage conferred by preferring certain counties over others in the distribution of funds;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(7) Elections in Georgia are administered by counties, but that can lead to problems for voters in counties with dysfunctional election systems. Counties with
 long-term problems of lines, problems with processing of absentee ballots, and other challenges in administration need accountability, but state officials are limited in what they are able to do to address those problems. Ensuring there is a mechanism t
o address local election problems will promote voter confidence and meet the goal of uniformity;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(8) Elections are a public process and public participation is encouraged by all involved, but the enthusiasm of some outside groups in sending multiple absen
tee ballot applications in 2020, often with incorrectly filled-in voter information, led to significant confusion by electors. Clarifying the rules regarding absentee ballot applications will build elector confidence while not sacrificing the opportuniti
es for electors to participate in the process;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(9) The lengthy absentee ballot process also led to elector confusion, including electors who were told they had already voted when they arrived to vote in pe
rson. Creating a definite period of absentee voting will assist electors in understanding the election process while also ensuring that opportunities to vote are not diminished, especially when many absentee ballots issued in the last few days before the
 election were not successfully voted or were returned late;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(10) Opportunities for delivering absentee ballots to a drop box were first created by the State Election Board as a pandemic response. The drop boxes created
 by rule no longer existed in Georgia law when the emergency rules that created them expired. The General Assembly considered a variety of options and constructed a system that allows the use of drop boxes, while also ensuring the security of the system 
and providing options in emergency situations;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(11) The lengthy nine-week runoffs in 2020 were exhausting for candidates, donors, and electors. By adding ranked choice voting for military and overseas vote
rs, the run-off period can be shortened to a more manageable period for all involved, easing the burden on election officials and on electors;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(12) Counting absentee ballots in 2020 took an incredibly long time in some counties. Creating processes for early processing and scanning of absentee ballots
 will promote elector confidence by ensuring that results are reported quickly;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(13) The sanctity of the precinct was also brought into sharp focus in 2020, with many groups approaching electors while they waited in line. Protecting elect

\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(1) Following the 2018 and 2020 elections, there was a significant lack of confidence in Georgia election systems, with many electors concerned about allegati
ons of rampant voter suppression and many electors concerned about allegations of rampant voter fraud;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(2) Many Georgia election processes were challenged in court, including the subjective signature-matching requirements, by Georgians on all sides of the polit
ical spectrum before and after the 2020 general election;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(3) The stress of the 2020 elections, with a dramatic increase in absentee-by-mail ballots and pandemic restrictions, demonstrated where there were opportunit
ies to update existing processes to reduce the burden on election officials and boost voter confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(4) The changes made in this legislation in 2021 are designed to address the lack of elector confidence in the election system on all sides of the political s
pectrum, to reduce the burden on election officials, and to streamline the process of conducting elections in Georgia by promoting uniformity in voting. Several examples will help explain how these goals are achieved;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(5) The broad discretion allowed to local officials for advance voting dates and hours led to significant variations across the state in total number of hours
 of advance voting, depending on the county. More than 100 counties have never offered voting on Sunday and many counties offered only a single day of weekend voting. Requiring two Saturday voting days and two optional Sunday voting days will dramaticall
y increase the total voting hours for voters across the State of Georgia, and all electors in Georgia will have access to multiple opportunities to vote in person on the weekend for the first time;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(6) Some counties in 2020 received significant infusions of grant funding for election operations, while other counties received no such funds. Promoting unif
ormity in the distribution of funds to election operations will boost voter confidence and ensure that there is no political advantage conferred by preferring certain counties over others in the distribution of funds;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(7) Elections in Georgia are administered by counties, but that can lead to problems for voters in counties with dysfunctional election systems. Counties with
 long-term problems of lines, problems with processing of absentee ballots, and other challenges in administration need accountability, but state officials are limited in what they are able to do to address those problems. Ensuring there is a mechanism t
o address local election problems will promote voter confidence and meet the goal of uniformity;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(8) Elections are a public process and public participation is encouraged by all involved, but the enthusiasm of some outside groups in sending multiple absen
tee ballot applications in 2020, often with incorrectly filled-in voter information, led to significant confusion by electors. Clarifying the rules regarding absentee ballot applications will build elector confidence while not sacrificing the opportuniti
es for electors to participate in the process;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(9) The lengthy absentee ballot process also led to elector confusion, including electors who were told they had already voted when they arrived to vote in pe
rson. Creating a definite period of absentee voting will assist electors in understanding the election process while also ensuring that opportunities to vote are not diminished, especially when many absentee ballots issued in the last few days before the
 election were not successfully voted or were returned late;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(10) Opportunities for delivering absentee ballots to a drop box were first created by the State Election Board as a pandemic response. The drop boxes created
 by rule no longer existed in Georgia law when the emergency rules that created them expired. The General Assembly considered a variety of options and constructed a system that allows the use of drop boxes, while also ensuring the security of the system 
and providing options in emergency situations;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(11) The lengthy nine-week runoffs in 2020 were exhausting for candidates, donors, and electors. By adding ranked choice voting for military and overseas vote
rs, the run-off period can be shortened to a more manageable period for all involved, easing the burden on election officials and on electors;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(12) Counting absentee ballots in 2020 took an incredibly long time in some counties. Creating processes for early processing and scanning of absentee ballots
 will promote elector confidence by ensuring that results are reported quickly;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(13) The sanctity of the precinct was also brought into sharp focus in 2020, with many groups approaching electors while they waited in line. Protecting elect
ors from improper interference, political pressure, or intimidation while waiting in line to vote is of paramount importance to protecting the election system and ensuring elector confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(14) Ballot duplication for provisional ballots and other purposes places a heavy burden on election officials. The number of duplicated ballots has continued

\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(1) Following the 2018 and 2020 elections, there was a significant lack of confidence in Georgia election systems, with many electors concerned about allegati
ons of rampant voter suppression and many electors concerned about allegations of rampant voter fraud;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(2) Many Georgia election processes were challenged in court, including the subjective signature-matching requirements, by Georgians on all sides of the polit
ical spectrum before and after the 2020 general election;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(3) The stress of the 2020 elections, with a dramatic increase in absentee-by-mail ballots and pandemic restrictions, demonstrated where there were opportunit
ies to update existing processes to reduce the burden on election officials and boost voter confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(4) The changes made in this legislation in 2021 are designed to address the lack of elector confidence in the election system on all sides of the political s
pectrum, to reduce the burden on election officials, and to streamline the process of conducting elections in Georgia by promoting uniformity in voting. Several examples will help explain how these goals are achieved;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(5) The broad discretion allowed to local officials for advance voting dates and hours led to significant variations across the state in total number of hours
 of advance voting, depending on the county. More than 100 counties have never offered voting on Sunday and many counties offered only a single day of weekend voting. Requiring two Saturday voting days and two optional Sunday voting days will dramaticall
y increase the total voting hours for voters across the State of Georgia, and all electors in Georgia will have access to multiple opportunities to vote in person on the weekend for the first time;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(6) Some counties in 2020 received significant infusions of grant funding for election operations, while other counties received no such funds. Promoting unif
ormity in the distribution of funds to election operations will boost voter confidence and ensure that there is no political advantage conferred by preferring certain counties over others in the distribution of funds;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(7) Elections in Georgia are administered by counties, but that can lead to problems for voters in counties with dysfunctional election systems. Counties with
 long-term problems of lines, problems with processing of absentee ballots, and other challenges in administration need accountability, but state officials are limited in what they are able to do to address those problems. Ensuring there is a mechanism t
o address local election problems will promote voter confidence and meet the goal of uniformity;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(8) Elections are a public process and public participation is encouraged by all involved, but the enthusiasm of some outside groups in sending multiple absen
tee ballot applications in 2020, often with incorrectly filled-in voter information, led to significant confusion by electors. Clarifying the rules regarding absentee ballot applications will build elector confidence while not sacrificing the opportuniti
es for electors to participate in the process;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(9) The lengthy absentee ballot process also led to elector confusion, including electors who were told they had already voted when they arrived to vote in pe
rson. Creating a definite period of absentee voting will assist electors in understanding the election process while also ensuring that opportunities to vote are not diminished, especially when many absentee ballots issued in the last few days before the
 election were not successfully voted or were returned late;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(10) Opportunities for delivering absentee ballots to a drop box were first created by the State Election Board as a pandemic response. The drop boxes created
 by rule no longer existed in Georgia law when the emergency rules that created them expired. The General Assembly considered a variety of options and constructed a system that allows the use of drop boxes, while also ensuring the security of the system 
and providing options in emergency situations;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(11) The lengthy nine-week runoffs in 2020 were exhausting for candidates, donors, and electors. By adding ranked choice voting for military and overseas vote
rs, the run-off period can be shortened to a more manageable period for all involved, easing the burden on election officials and on electors;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(12) Counting absentee ballots in 2020 took an incredibly long time in some counties. Creating processes for early processing and scanning of absentee ballots
 will promote elector confidence by ensuring that results are reported quickly;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(13) The sanctity of the precinct was also brought into sharp focus in 2020, with many groups approaching electors while they waited in line. Protecting elect
ors from improper interference, political pressure, or intimidation while waiting in line to vote is of paramount importance to protecting the election system and ensuring elector confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(14) Ballot duplication for provisional ballots and other purposes places a heavy burden on election officials. The number of duplicated ballots has continued
 to rise dramatically from 2016 through 2020. Reducing the number of duplicated ballots will significantly reduce the burden on election officials and creating bipartisan panels to conduct duplication will promote elector confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(15) Electors voting out of precinct add to the burden on election officials and lines for other electors because of the length of time it takes to process a 
provisional ballot in a precinct. Electors should be directed to the correct precinct on election day to ensure that they are able to vote in all elections for which they are eligible;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(16) In considering the changes in 2021, the General Assembly heard hours of testimony from electors, election officials, and attorneys involved in voting. Th
e General Assembly made significant modifications through the legislative process as it weighed the various interests involved, including adding further weekend voting, changing parameters for out-of-precinct voting, and adding transparency for ballot im
ages; and
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(17) While each of the changes in this legislation in 2021 stands alone and is severable under Code Section 1-1-3, the changes in total reflect the General As
sembly\'92s considered judgment on the changes required to Georgia\'92s election system to make it \'91easy to vote and hard to cheat,\'92 applying the lessons learned from conducting an election in the 2020 pandemic.\'94

\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(5) The broad discretion allowed to local officials for advance voting dates and hours led to significant variations across the state in total number of hours
 of advance voting, depending on the county. More than 100 counties have never offered voting on Sunday and many counties offered only a single day of weekend voting. Requiring two Saturday voting days and two optional Sunday voting days will dramaticall
y increase the total voting hours for voters across the State of Georgia, and all electors in Georgia will have access to multiple opportunities to vote in person on the weekend for the first time;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(6) Some counties in 2020 received significant infusions of grant funding for election operations, while other counties received no such funds. Promoting unif
ormity in the distribution of funds to election operations will boost voter confidence and ensure that there is no political advantage conferred by preferring certain counties over others in the distribution of funds;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(7) Elections in Georgia are administered by counties, but that can lead to problems for voters in counties with dysfunctional election systems. Counties with
 long-term problems of lines, problems with processing of absentee ballots, and other challenges in administration need accountability, but state officials are limited in what they are able to do to address those problems. Ensuring there is a mechanism t
o address local election problems will promote voter confidence and meet the goal of uniformity;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(8) Elections are a public process and public participation is encouraged by all involved, but the enthusiasm of some outside groups in sending multiple absen
tee ballot applications in 2020, often with incorrectly filled-in voter information, led to significant confusion by electors. Clarifying the rules regarding absentee ballot applications will build elector confidence while not sacrificing the opportuniti
es for electors to participate in the process;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(9) The lengthy absentee ballot process also led to elector confusion, including electors who were told they had already voted when they arrived to vote in pe
rson. Creating a definite period of absentee voting will assist electors in understanding the election process while also ensuring that opportunities to vote are not diminished, especially when many absentee ballots issued in the last few days before the
 election were not successfully voted or were returned late;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(10) Opportunities for delivering absentee ballots to a drop box were first created by the State Election Board as a pandemic response. The drop boxes created
 by rule no longer existed in Georgia law when the emergency rules that created them expired. The General Assembly considered a variety of options and constructed a system that allows the use of drop boxes, while also ensuring the security of the system 
and providing options in emergency situations;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(11) The lengthy nine-week runoffs in 2020 were exhausting for candidates, donors, and electors. By adding ranked choice voting for military and overseas vote
rs, the run-off period can be shortened to a more manageable period for all involved, easing the burden on election officials and on electors;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(12) Counting absentee ballots in 2020 took an incredibly long time in some counties. Creating processes for early processing and scanning of absentee ballots
 will promote elector confidence by ensuring that results are reported quickly;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(13) The sanctity of the precinct was also brought into sharp focus in 2020, with many groups approaching electors while they waited in line. Protecting elect
ors from improper interference, political pressure, or intimidation while waiting in line to vote is of paramount importance to protecting the election system and ensuring elector confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(14) Ballot duplication for provisional ballots and other purposes places a heavy burden on election officials. The number of duplicated ballots has continued
 to rise dramatically from 2016 through 2020. Reducing the number of duplicated ballots will significantly reduce the burden on election officials and creating bipartisan panels to conduct duplication will promote elector confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(15) Electors voting out of precinct add to the burden on election officials and lines for other electors because of the length of time it takes to process a 
provisional ballot in a precinct. Electors should be directed to the correct precinct on election day to ensure that they are able to vote in all elections for which they are eligible;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(16) In considering the changes in 2021, the General Assembly heard hours of testimony from electors, election officials, and attorneys involved in voting. Th
e General Assembly made significant modifications through the legislative process as it weighed the various interests involved, including adding further weekend voting, changing parameters for out-of-precinct voting, and adding transparency for ballot im
ages; and
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(17) While each of the changes in this legislation in 2021 stands alone and is severable under Code Section 1-1-3, the changes in total reflect the General As

\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(1) Following the 2018 and 2020 elections, there was a significant lack of confidence in Georgia election systems, with many electors concerned about allegati
ons of rampant voter suppression and many electors concerned about allegations of rampant voter fraud;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(2) Many Georgia election processes were challenged in court, including the subjective signature-matching requirements, by Georgians on all sides of the polit
ical spectrum before and after the 2020 general election;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(3) The stress of the 2020 elections, with a dramatic increase in absentee-by-mail ballots and pandemic restrictions, demonstrated where there were opportunit
ies to update existing processes to reduce the burden on election officials and boost voter confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(4) The changes made in this legislation in 2021 are designed to address the lack of elector confidence in the election system on all sides of the political s
pectrum, to reduce the burden on election officials, and to streamline the process of conducting elections in Georgia by promoting uniformity in voting. Several examples will help explain how these goals are achieved;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(5) The broad discretion allowed to local officials for advance voting dates and hours led to significant variations across the state in total number of hours
 of advance voting, depending on the county. More than 100 counties have never offered voting on Sunday and many counties offered only a single day of weekend voting. Requiring two Saturday voting days and two optional Sunday voting days will dramaticall
y increase the total voting hours for voters across the State of Georgia, and all electors in Georgia will have access to multiple opportunities to vote in person on the weekend for the first time;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(6) Some counties in 2020 received significant infusions of grant funding for election operations, while other counties received no such funds. Promoting unif
ormity in the distribution of funds to election operations will boost voter confidence and ensure that there is no political advantage conferred by preferring certain counties over others in the distribution of funds;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(7) Elections in Georgia are administered by counties, but that can lead to problems for voters in counties with dysfunctional election systems. Counties with
 long-term problems of lines, problems with processing of absentee ballots, and other challenges in administration need accountability, but state officials are limited in what they are able to do to address those problems. Ensuring there is a mechanism t
o address local election problems will promote voter confidence and meet the goal of uniformity;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(8) Elections are a public process and public participation is encouraged by all involved, but the enthusiasm of some outside groups in sending multiple absen
tee ballot applications in 2020, often with incorrectly filled-in voter information, led to significant confusion by electors. Clarifying the rules regarding absentee ballot applications will build elector confidence while not sacrificing the opportuniti
es for electors to participate in the process;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(9) The lengthy absentee ballot process also led to elector confusion, including electors who were told they had already voted when they arrived to vote in pe
rson. Creating a definite period of absentee voting will assist electors in understanding the election process while also ensuring that opportunities to vote are not diminished, especially when many absentee ballots issued in the last few days before the
 election were not successfully voted or were returned late;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(10) Opportunities for delivering absentee ballots to a drop box were first created by the State Election Board as a pandemic response. The drop boxes created
 by rule no longer existed in Georgia law when the emergency rules that created them expired. The General Assembly considered a variety of options and constructed a system that allows the use of drop boxes, while also ensuring the security of the system 
and providing options in emergency situations;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(11) The lengthy nine-week runoffs in 2020 were exhausting for candidates, donors, and electors. By adding ranked choice voting for military and overseas vote
rs, the run-off period can be shortened to a more manageable period for all involved, easing the burden on election officials and on electors;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(12) Counting absentee ballots in 2020 took an incredibly long time in some counties. Creating processes for early processing and scanning of absentee ballots
 will promote elector confidence by ensuring that results are reported quickly;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(13) The sanctity of the precinct was also brought into sharp focus in 2020, with many groups approaching electors while they waited in line. Protecting elect
ors from improper interference, political pressure, or intimidation while waiting in line to vote is of paramount importance to protecting the election system and ensuring elector confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(14) Ballot duplication for provisional ballots and other purposes places a heavy burden on election officials. The number of duplicated ballots has continued
 to rise dramatically from 2016 through 2020. Reducing the number of duplicated ballots will significantly reduce the burden on election officials and creating bipartisan panels to conduct duplication will promote elector confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(15) Electors voting out of precinct add to the burden on election officials and lines for other electors because of the length of time it takes to process a 
provisional ballot in a precinct. Electors should be directed to the correct precinct on election day to ensure that they are able to vote in all elections for which they are eligible;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(16) In considering the changes in 2021, the General Assembly heard hours of testimony from electors, election officials, and attorneys involved in voting. Th
e General Assembly made significant modifications through the legislative process as it weighed the various interests involved, including adding further weekend voting, changing parameters for out-of-precinct voting, and adding transparency for ballot im
ages; and
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(17) While each of the changes in this legislation in 2021 stands alone and is severable under Code Section 1-1-3, the changes in total reflect the General As
sembly\'92s considered judgment on the changes required to Georgia\'92s election system to make it \'91easy to vote and hard to cheat,\'92 applying the lessons learned from conducting an election in the 2020 pandemic.\'94

er of his or her own motion or upon the sworn petition of three electors of any precinct, order a recanvass of the votes shown on that particular machine or machines. Such recanvass may be conducted at any time prior to the certification of the consolida

chine or machines and the number of the protective counter or other device; shall make visible the registering counters of each such machine; and, without unlocking the machine against voting, shall recanvass the vote thereon. Before making such recanvas
s, the superintendent shall give notice in writing to the custodian of voting machines, to each candidate, and to the county or municipal chairperson of each party or body affected by the recanvass. Each such candidate may be present in person or by repr
esentative, and each of such parties or bodies may send two representatives to be present at such recanvass. If, upon such recanvass, it shall be found that the original canvass of the returns has been correctly made from the machine and that the discrep
ancy still remains unaccounted for, the superintendent, with the assistance of the custodian, in the presence of the poll officers and the authorized candidates and representatives, shall unlock the voting and counting mechanism of the machine and shall 
proceed thoroughly to examine and test the machine to determine and reveal the true cause or causes, if any, of the discrepancy in returns from such machine. Each counter shall be reset at zero before it is tested, after which it shall be operated at lea
st 100 times. After the completion of such examination and test, the custodian shall then and there prepare a statement, in writing, giving in detail the result of the examination and test; and such statement shall be witnessed by the persons present and
 shall be filed with the superintendent. If, upon such recanvass, it shall appear that the original canvass of the returns by the poll officers was incorrect, such returns and all papers being prepared by the superintendent shall be corrected accordingly
; provided, however, that in the case of returns from any precinct wherein the primary or election was held by the use of a voting machine equipped with a mechanism for printing paper proof sheets, such proof sheets, if mutually consistent, shall be deem
ed to be prima-facie evidence of the result of the primary or election and to be prima facie accurate; and there shall not be considered to be any discrepancy or error in the returns from any such precinct, such as to require a recanvass of the vote, if 
all available proof sheets, from the voting machine used therein, identified to the satisfaction of the superintendent and shown to his or her satisfaction to have been produced from proper custody, shall be mutually consistent; and, if the general and d
uplicate returns, or either of such returns from such precincts shall not correspond with such proof sheets, they and all other papers being prepared by the superintendent shall be corrected so as to correspond with such proof sheets in the absence of al
legation of specific fraud or error proved to the satisfaction of the superintendent by the weight of the evidence; and only in such case shall the vote of such precinct be recanvassed under this Code section.

ons of rampant voter suppression and many electors concerned about allegations of rampant voter fraud;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(2) Many Georgia election processes were challenged in court, including the subjective signature-matching requirements, by Georgians on all sides of the polit
ical spectrum before and after the 2020 general election;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(3) The stress of the 2020 elections, with a dramatic increase in absentee-by-mail ballots and pandemic restrictions, demonstrated where there were opportunit
ies to update existing processes to reduce the burden on election officials and boost voter confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(4) The changes made in this legislation in 2021 are designed to address the lack of elector confidence in the election system on all sides of the political s
pectrum, to reduce the burden on election officials, and to streamline the process of conducting elections in Georgia by promoting uniformity in voting. Several examples will help explain how these goals are achieved;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(5) The broad discretion allowed to local officials for advance voting dates and hours led to significant variations across the state in total number of hours
 of advance voting, depending on the county. More than 100 counties have never offered voting on Sunday and many counties offered only a single day of weekend voting. Requiring two Saturday voting days and two optional Sunday voting days will dramaticall
y increase the total voting hours for voters across the State of Georgia, and all electors in Georgia will have access to multiple opportunities to vote in person on the weekend for the first time;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(6) Some counties in 2020 received significant infusions of grant funding for election operations, while other counties received no such funds. Promoting unif
ormity in the distribution of funds to election operations will boost voter confidence and ensure that there is no political advantage conferred by preferring certain counties over others in the distribution of funds;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(7) Elections in Georgia are administered by counties, but that can lead to problems for voters in counties with dysfunctional election systems. Counties with
 long-term problems of lines, problems with processing of absentee ballots, and other challenges in administration need accountability, but state officials are limited in what they are able to do to address those problems. Ensuring there is a mechanism t
o address local election problems will promote voter confidence and meet the goal of uniformity;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(8) Elections are a public process and public participation is encouraged by all involved, but the enthusiasm of some outside groups in sending multiple absen
tee ballot applications in 2020, often with incorrectly filled-in voter information, led to significant confusion by electors. Clarifying the rules regarding absentee ballot applications will build elector confidence while not sacrificing the opportuniti
es for electors to participate in the process;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(9) The lengthy absentee ballot process also led to elector confusion, including electors who were told they had already voted when they arrived to vote in pe
rson. Creating a definite period of absentee voting will assist electors in understanding the election process while also ensuring that opportunities to vote are not diminished, especially when many absentee ballots issued in the last few days before the
 election were not successfully voted or were returned late;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(10) Opportunities for delivering absentee ballots to a drop box were first created by the State Election Board as a pandemic response. The drop boxes created
 by rule no longer existed in Georgia law when the emergency rules that created them expired. The General Assembly considered a variety of options and constructed a system that allows the use of drop boxes, while also ensuring the security of the system 
and providing options in emergency situations;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(11) The lengthy nine-week runoffs in 2020 were exhausting for candidates, donors, and electors. By adding ranked choice voting for military and overseas vote
rs, the run-off period can be shortened to a more manageable period for all involved, easing the burden on election officials and on electors;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(12) Counting absentee ballots in 2020 took an incredibly long time in some counties. Creating processes for early processing and scanning of absentee ballots
 will promote elector confidence by ensuring that results are reported quickly;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(13) The sanctity of the precinct was also brought into sharp focus in 2020, with many groups approaching electors while they waited in line. Protecting elect
ors from improper interference, political pressure, or intimidation while waiting in line to vote is of paramount importance to protecting the election system and ensuring elector confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(14) Ballot duplication for provisional ballots and other purposes places a heavy burden on election officials. The number of duplicated ballots has continued
 to rise dramatically from 2016 through 2020. Reducing the number of duplicated ballots will significantly reduce the burden on election officials and creating bipartisan panels to conduct duplication will promote elector confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(15) Electors voting out of precinct add to the burden on election officials and lines for other electors because of the length of time it takes to process a 
provisional ballot in a precinct. Electors should be directed to the correct precinct on election day to ensure that they are able to vote in all elections for which they are eligible;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(16) In considering the changes in 2021, the General Assembly heard hours of testimony from electors, election officials, and attorneys involved in voting. Th
e General Assembly made significant modifications through the legislative process as it weighed the various interests involved, including adding further weekend voting, changing parameters for out-of-precinct voting, and adding transparency for ballot im

\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(1) Following the 2018 and 2020 elections, there was a significant lack of confidence in Georgia election systems, with many electors concerned about allegati
ons of rampant voter suppression and many electors concerned about allegations of rampant voter fraud;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(2) Many Georgia election processes were challenged in court, including the subjective signature-matching requirements, by Georgians on all sides of the polit
ical spectrum before and after the 2020 general election;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(3) The stress of the 2020 elections, with a dramatic increase in absentee-by-mail ballots and pandemic restrictions, demonstrated where there were opportunit
ies to update existing processes to reduce the burden on election officials and boost voter confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(4) The changes made in this legislation in 2021 are designed to address the lack of elector confidence in the election system on all sides of the political s
pectrum, to reduce the burden on election officials, and to streamline the process of conducting elections in Georgia by promoting uniformity in voting. Several examples will help explain how these goals are achieved;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(5) The broad discretion allowed to local officials for advance voting dates and hours led to significant variations across the state in total number of hours
 of advance voting, depending on the county. More than 100 counties have never offered voting on Sunday and many counties offered only a single day of weekend voting. Requiring two Saturday voting days and two optional Sunday voting days will dramaticall
y increase the total voting hours for voters across the State of Georgia, and all electors in Georgia will have access to multiple opportunities to vote in person on the weekend for the first time;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(6) Some counties in 2020 received significant infusions of grant funding for election operations, while other counties received no such funds. Promoting unif
ormity in the distribution of funds to election operations will boost voter confidence and ensure that there is no political advantage conferred by preferring certain counties over others in the distribution of funds;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(7) Elections in Georgia are administered by counties, but that can lead to problems for voters in counties with dysfunctional election systems. Counties with
 long-term problems of lines, problems with processing of absentee ballots, and other challenges in administration need accountability, but state officials are limited in what they are able to do to address those problems. Ensuring there is a mechanism t
o address local election problems will promote voter confidence and meet the goal of uniformity;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(8) Elections are a public process and public participation is encouraged by all involved, but the enthusiasm of some outside groups in sending multiple absen
tee ballot applications in 2020, often with incorrectly filled-in voter information, led to significant confusion by electors. Clarifying the rules regarding absentee ballot applications will build elector confidence while not sacrificing the opportuniti
es for electors to participate in the process;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(9) The lengthy absentee ballot process also led to elector confusion, including electors who were told they had already voted when they arrived to vote in pe
rson. Creating a definite period of absentee voting will assist electors in understanding the election process while also ensuring that opportunities to vote are not diminished, especially when many absentee ballots issued in the last few days before the
 election were not successfully voted or were returned late;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(10) Opportunities for delivering absentee ballots to a drop box were first created by the State Election Board as a pandemic response. The drop boxes created
 by rule no longer existed in Georgia law when the emergency rules that created them expired. The General Assembly considered a variety of options and constructed a system that allows the use of drop boxes, while also ensuring the security of the system 
and providing options in emergency situations;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(11) The lengthy nine-week runoffs in 2020 were exhausting for candidates, donors, and electors. By adding ranked choice voting for military and overseas vote
rs, the run-off period can be shortened to a more manageable period for all involved, easing the burden on election officials and on electors;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(12) Counting absentee ballots in 2020 took an incredibly long time in some counties. Creating processes for early processing and scanning of absentee ballots
 will promote elector confidence by ensuring that results are reported quickly;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(13) The sanctity of the precinct was also brought into sharp focus in 2020, with many groups approaching electors while they waited in line. Protecting elect
ors from improper interference, political pressure, or intimidation while waiting in line to vote is of paramount importance to protecting the election system and ensuring elector confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(14) Ballot duplication for provisional ballots and other purposes places a heavy burden on election officials. The number of duplicated ballots has continued
 to rise dramatically from 2016 through 2020. Reducing the number of duplicated ballots will significantly reduce the burden on election officials and creating bipartisan panels to conduct duplication will promote elector confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(15) Electors voting out of precinct add to the burden on election officials and lines for other electors because of the length of time it takes to process a 
provisional ballot in a precinct. Electors should be directed to the correct precinct on election day to ensure that they are able to vote in all elections for which they are eligible;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(16) In considering the changes in 2021, the General Assembly heard hours of testimony from electors, election officials, and attorneys involved in voting. Th
e General Assembly made significant modifications through the legislative process as it weighed the various interests involved, including adding further weekend voting, changing parameters for out-of-precinct voting, and adding transparency for ballot im
ages; and

\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(1) Following the 2018 and 2020 elections, there was a significant lack of confidence in Georgia election systems, with many electors concerned about allegati
ons of rampant voter suppression and many electors concerned about allegations of rampant voter fraud;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(2) Many Georgia election processes were challenged in court, including the subjective signature-matching requirements, by Georgians on all sides of the polit
ical spectrum before and after the 2020 general election;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(3) The stress of the 2020 elections, with a dramatic increase in absentee-by-mail ballots and pandemic restrictions, demonstrated where there were opportunit
ies to update existing processes to reduce the burden on election officials and boost voter confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(4) The changes made in this legislation in 2021 are designed to address the lack of elector confidence in the election system on all sides of the political s
pectrum, to reduce the burden on election officials, and to streamline the process of conducting elections in Georgia by promoting uniformity in voting. Several examples will help explain how these goals are achieved;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(5) The broad discretion allowed to local officials for advance voting dates and hours led to significant variations across the state in total number of hours
 of advance voting, depending on the county. More than 100 counties have never offered voting on Sunday and many counties offered only a single day of weekend voting. Requiring two Saturday voting days and two optional Sunday voting days will dramaticall
y increase the total voting hours for voters across the State of Georgia, and all electors in Georgia will have access to multiple opportunities to vote in person on the weekend for the first time;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(6) Some counties in 2020 received significant infusions of grant funding for election operations, while other counties received no such funds. Promoting unif
ormity in the distribution of funds to election operations will boost voter confidence and ensure that there is no political advantage conferred by preferring certain counties over others in the distribution of funds;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(7) Elections in Georgia are administered by counties, but that can lead to problems for voters in counties with dysfunctional election systems. Counties with
 long-term problems of lines, problems with processing of absentee ballots, and other challenges in administration need accountability, but state officials are limited in what they are able to do to address those problems. Ensuring there is a mechanism t
o address local election problems will promote voter confidence and meet the goal of uniformity;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(8) Elections are a public process and public participation is encouraged by all involved, but the enthusiasm of some outside groups in sending multiple absen
tee ballot applications in 2020, often with incorrectly filled-in voter information, led to significant confusion by electors. Clarifying the rules regarding absentee ballot applications will build elector confidence while not sacrificing the opportuniti
es for electors to participate in the process;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(9) The lengthy absentee ballot process also led to elector confusion, including electors who were told they had already voted when they arrived to vote in pe
rson. Creating a definite period of absentee voting will assist electors in understanding the election process while also ensuring that opportunities to vote are not diminished, especially when many absentee ballots issued in the last few days before the
 election were not successfully voted or were returned late;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(10) Opportunities for delivering absentee ballots to a drop box were first created by the State Election Board as a pandemic response. The drop boxes created
 by rule no longer existed in Georgia law when the emergency rules that created them expired. The General Assembly considered a variety of options and constructed a system that allows the use of drop boxes, while also ensuring the security of the system 
and providing options in emergency situations;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(11) The lengthy nine-week runoffs in 2020 were exhausting for candidates, donors, and electors. By adding ranked choice voting for military and overseas vote
rs, the run-off period can be shortened to a more manageable period for all involved, easing the burden on election officials and on electors;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(12) Counting absentee ballots in 2020 took an incredibly long time in some counties. Creating processes for early processing and scanning of absentee ballots
 will promote elector confidence by ensuring that results are reported quickly;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(13) The sanctity of the precinct was also brought into sharp focus in 2020, with many groups approaching electors while they waited in line. Protecting elect
ors from improper interference, political pressure, or intimidation while waiting in line to vote is of paramount importance to protecting the election system and ensuring elector confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(14) Ballot duplication for provisional ballots and other purposes places a heavy burden on election officials. The number of duplicated ballots has continued
 to rise dramatically from 2016 through 2020. Reducing the number of duplicated ballots will significantly reduce the burden on election officials and creating bipartisan panels to conduct duplication will promote elector confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(15) Electors voting out of precinct add to the burden on election officials and lines for other electors because of the length of time it takes to process a 
provisional ballot in a precinct. Electors should be directed to the correct precinct on election day to ensure that they are able to vote in all elections for which they are eligible;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(16) In considering the changes in 2021, the General Assembly heard hours of testimony from electors, election officials, and attorneys involved in voting. Th
e General Assembly made significant modifications through the legislative process as it weighed the various interests involved, including adding further weekend voting, changing parameters for out-of-precinct voting, and adding transparency for ballot im

\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(1) Following the 2018 and 2020 elections, there was a significant lack of confidence in Georgia election systems, with many electors concerned about allegati
ons of rampant voter suppression and many electors concerned about allegations of rampant voter fraud;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(2) Many Georgia election processes were challenged in court, including the subjective signature-matching requirements, by Georgians on all sides of the polit
ical spectrum before and after the 2020 general election;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(3) The stress of the 2020 elections, with a dramatic increase in absentee-by-mail ballots and pandemic restrictions, demonstrated where there were opportunit
ies to update existing processes to reduce the burden on election officials and boost voter confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(4) The changes made in this legislation in 2021 are designed to address the lack of elector confidence in the election system on all sides of the political s
pectrum, to reduce the burden on election officials, and to streamline the process of conducting elections in Georgia by promoting uniformity in voting. Several examples will help explain how these goals are achieved;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(5) The broad discretion allowed to local officials for advance voting dates and hours led to significant variations across the state in total number of hours
 of advance voting, depending on the county. More than 100 counties have never offered voting on Sunday and many counties offered only a single day of weekend voting. Requiring two Saturday voting days and two optional Sunday voting days will dramaticall
y increase the total voting hours for voters across the State of Georgia, and all electors in Georgia will have access to multiple opportunities to vote in person on the weekend for the first time;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(6) Some counties in 2020 received significant infusions of grant funding for election operations, while other counties received no such funds. Promoting unif
ormity in the distribution of funds to election operations will boost voter confidence and ensure that there is no political advantage conferred by preferring certain counties over others in the distribution of funds;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(7) Elections in Georgia are administered by counties, but that can lead to problems for voters in counties with dysfunctional election systems. Counties with
 long-term problems of lines, problems with processing of absentee ballots, and other challenges in administration need accountability, but state officials are limited in what they are able to do to address those problems. Ensuring there is a mechanism t
o address local election problems will promote voter confidence and meet the goal of uniformity;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(8) Elections are a public process and public participation is encouraged by all involved, but the enthusiasm of some outside groups in sending multiple absen
tee ballot applications in 2020, often with incorrectly filled-in voter information, led to significant confusion by electors. Clarifying the rules regarding absentee ballot applications will build elector confidence while not sacrificing the opportuniti
es for electors to participate in the process;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(9) The lengthy absentee ballot process also led to elector confusion, including electors who were told they had already voted when they arrived to vote in pe
rson. Creating a definite period of absentee voting will assist electors in understanding the election process while also ensuring that opportunities to vote are not diminished, especially when many absentee ballots issued in the last few days before the
 election were not successfully voted or were returned late;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(10) Opportunities for delivering absentee ballots to a drop box were first created by the State Election Board as a pandemic response. The drop boxes created
 by rule no longer existed in Georgia law when the emergency rules that created them expired. The General Assembly considered a variety of options and constructed a system that allows the use of drop boxes, while also ensuring the security of the system 
and providing options in emergency situations;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(11) The lengthy nine-week runoffs in 2020 were exhausting for candidates, donors, and electors. By adding ranked choice voting for military and overseas vote
rs, the run-off period can be shortened to a more manageable period for all involved, easing the burden on election officials and on electors;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(12) Counting absentee ballots in 2020 took an incredibly long time in some counties. Creating processes for early processing and scanning of absentee ballots
 will promote elector confidence by ensuring that results are reported quickly;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(13) The sanctity of the precinct was also brought into sharp focus in 2020, with many groups approaching electors while they waited in line. Protecting elect
ors from improper interference, political pressure, or intimidation while waiting in line to vote is of paramount importance to protecting the election system and ensuring elector confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(14) Ballot duplication for provisional ballots and other purposes places a heavy burden on election officials. The number of duplicated ballots has continued
 to rise dramatically from 2016 through 2020. Reducing the number of duplicated ballots will significantly reduce the burden on election officials and creating bipartisan panels to conduct duplication will promote elector confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(15) Electors voting out of precinct add to the burden on election officials and lines for other electors because of the length of time it takes to process a 
provisional ballot in a precinct. Electors should be directed to the correct precinct on election day to ensure that they are able to vote in all elections for which they are eligible;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(16) In considering the changes in 2021, the General Assembly heard hours of testimony from electors, election officials, and attorneys involved in voting. Th
e General Assembly made significant modifications through the legislative process as it weighed the various interests involved, including adding further weekend voting, changing parameters for out-of-precinct voting, and adding transparency for ballot im
ages; and

\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(1) Following the 2018 and 2020 elections, there was a significant lack of confidence in Georgia election systems, with many electors concerned about allegati
ons of rampant voter suppression and many electors concerned about allegations of rampant voter fraud;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(2) Many Georgia election processes were challenged in court, including the subjective signature-matching requirements, by Georgians on all sides of the polit
ical spectrum before and after the 2020 general election;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(3) The stress of the 2020 elections, with a dramatic increase in absentee-by-mail ballots and pandemic restrictions, demonstrated where there were opportunit
ies to update existing processes to reduce the burden on election officials and boost voter confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(4) The changes made in this legislation in 2021 are designed to address the lack of elector confidence in the election system on all sides of the political s
pectrum, to reduce the burden on election officials, and to streamline the process of conducting elections in Georgia by promoting uniformity in voting. Several examples will help explain how these goals are achieved;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(5) The broad discretion allowed to local officials for advance voting dates and hours led to significant variations across the state in total number of hours
 of advance voting, depending on the county. More than 100 counties have never offered voting on Sunday and many counties offered only a single day of weekend voting. Requiring two Saturday voting days and two optional Sunday voting days will dramaticall
y increase the total voting hours for voters across the State of Georgia, and all electors in Georgia will have access to multiple opportunities to vote in person on the weekend for the first time;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(6) Some counties in 2020 received significant infusions of grant funding for election operations, while other counties received no such funds. Promoting unif
ormity in the distribution of funds to election operations will boost voter confidence and ensure that there is no political advantage conferred by preferring certain counties over others in the distribution of funds;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(7) Elections in Georgia are administered by counties, but that can lead to problems for voters in counties with dysfunctional election systems. Counties with
 long-term problems of lines, problems with processing of absentee ballots, and other challenges in administration need accountability, but state officials are limited in what they are able to do to address those problems. Ensuring there is a mechanism t
o address local election problems will promote voter confidence and meet the goal of uniformity;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(8) Elections are a public process and public participation is encouraged by all involved, but the enthusiasm of some outside groups in sending multiple absen
tee ballot applications in 2020, often with incorrectly filled-in voter information, led to significant confusion by electors. Clarifying the rules regarding absentee ballot applications will build elector confidence while not sacrificing the opportuniti
es for electors to participate in the process;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(9) The lengthy absentee ballot process also led to elector confusion, including electors who were told they had already voted when they arrived to vote in pe
rson. Creating a definite period of absentee voting will assist electors in understanding the election process while also ensuring that opportunities to vote are not diminished, especially when many absentee ballots issued in the last few days before the
 election were not successfully voted or were returned late;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(10) Opportunities for delivering absentee ballots to a drop box were first created by the State Election Board as a pandemic response. The drop boxes created
 by rule no longer existed in Georgia law when the emergency rules that created them expired. The General Assembly considered a variety of options and constructed a system that allows the use of drop boxes, while also ensuring the security of the system 
and providing options in emergency situations;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(11) The lengthy nine-week runoffs in 2020 were exhausting for candidates, donors, and electors. By adding ranked choice voting for military and overseas vote
rs, the run-off period can be shortened to a more manageable period for all involved, easing the burden on election officials and on electors;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(12) Counting absentee ballots in 2020 took an incredibly long time in some counties. Creating processes for early processing and scanning of absentee ballots
 will promote elector confidence by ensuring that results are reported quickly;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(13) The sanctity of the precinct was also brought into sharp focus in 2020, with many groups approaching electors while they waited in line. Protecting elect
ors from improper interference, political pressure, or intimidation while waiting in line to vote is of paramount importance to protecting the election system and ensuring elector confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(14) Ballot duplication for provisional ballots and other purposes places a heavy burden on election officials. The number of duplicated ballots has continued
 to rise dramatically from 2016 through 2020. Reducing the number of duplicated ballots will significantly reduce the burden on election officials and creating bipartisan panels to conduct duplication will promote elector confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(15) Electors voting out of precinct add to the burden on election officials and lines for other electors because of the length of time it takes to process a 
provisional ballot in a precinct. Electors should be directed to the correct precinct on election day to ensure that they are able to vote in all elections for which they are eligible;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(16) In considering the changes in 2021, the General Assembly heard hours of testimony from electors, election officials, and attorneys involved in voting. Th
e General Assembly made significant modifications through the legislative process as it weighed the various interests involved, including adding further weekend voting, changing parameters for out-of-precinct voting, and adding transparency for ballot im
ages; and
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(17) While each of the changes in this legislation in 2021 stands alone and is severable under Code Section 1-1-3, the changes in total reflect the General As
sembly\'92s considered judgment on the changes required to Georgia\'92s election system to make it \'91easy to vote and hard to cheat,\'92 applying the lessons learned from conducting an election in the 2020 pandemic.\'94

\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(1) Following the 2018 and 2020 elections, there was a significant lack of confidence in Georgia election systems, with many electors concerned about allegati
ons of rampant voter suppression and many electors concerned about allegations of rampant voter fraud;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(2) Many Georgia election processes were challenged in court, including the subjective signature-matching requirements, by Georgians on all sides of the polit
ical spectrum before and after the 2020 general election;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(3) The stress of the 2020 elections, with a dramatic increase in absentee-by-mail ballots and pandemic restrictions, demonstrated where there were opportunit
ies to update existing processes to reduce the burden on election officials and boost voter confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(4) The changes made in this legislation in 2021 are designed to address the lack of elector confidence in the election system on all sides of the political s
pectrum, to reduce the burden on election officials, and to streamline the process of conducting elections in Georgia by promoting uniformity in voting. Several examples will help explain how these goals are achieved;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(5) The broad discretion allowed to local officials for advance voting dates and hours led to significant variations across the state in total number of hours
 of advance voting, depending on the county. More than 100 counties have never offered voting on Sunday and many counties offered only a single day of weekend voting. Requiring two Saturday voting days and two optional Sunday voting days will dramaticall
y increase the total voting hours for voters across the State of Georgia, and all electors in Georgia will have access to multiple opportunities to vote in person on the weekend for the first time;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(6) Some counties in 2020 received significant infusions of grant funding for election operations, while other counties received no such funds. Promoting unif
ormity in the distribution of funds to election operations will boost voter confidence and ensure that there is no political advantage conferred by preferring certain counties over others in the distribution of funds;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(7) Elections in Georgia are administered by counties, but that can lead to problems for voters in counties with dysfunctional election systems. Counties with
 long-term problems of lines, problems with processing of absentee ballots, and other challenges in administration need accountability, but state officials are limited in what they are able to do to address those problems. Ensuring there is a mechanism t
o address local election problems will promote voter confidence and meet the goal of uniformity;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(8) Elections are a public process and public participation is encouraged by all involved, but the enthusiasm of some outside groups in sending multiple absen
tee ballot applications in 2020, often with incorrectly filled-in voter information, led to significant confusion by electors. Clarifying the rules regarding absentee ballot applications will build elector confidence while not sacrificing the opportuniti
es for electors to participate in the process;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(9) The lengthy absentee ballot process also led to elector confusion, including electors who were told they had already voted when they arrived to vote in pe
rson. Creating a definite period of absentee voting will assist electors in understanding the election process while also ensuring that opportunities to vote are not diminished, especially when many absentee ballots issued in the last few days before the
 election were not successfully voted or were returned late;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(10) Opportunities for delivering absentee ballots to a drop box were first created by the State Election Board as a pandemic response. The drop boxes created
 by rule no longer existed in Georgia law when the emergency rules that created them expired. The General Assembly considered a variety of options and constructed a system that allows the use of drop boxes, while also ensuring the security of the system 
and providing options in emergency situations;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(11) The lengthy nine-week runoffs in 2020 were exhausting for candidates, donors, and electors. By adding ranked choice voting for military and overseas vote
rs, the run-off period can be shortened to a more manageable period for all involved, easing the burden on election officials and on electors;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(12) Counting absentee ballots in 2020 took an incredibly long time in some counties. Creating processes for early processing and scanning of absentee ballots
 will promote elector confidence by ensuring that results are reported quickly;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(13) The sanctity of the precinct was also brought into sharp focus in 2020, with many groups approaching electors while they waited in line. Protecting elect
ors from improper interference, political pressure, or intimidation while waiting in line to vote is of paramount importance to protecting the election system and ensuring elector confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(14) Ballot duplication for provisional ballots and other purposes places a heavy burden on election officials. The number of duplicated ballots has continued
 to rise dramatically from 2016 through 2020. Reducing the number of duplicated ballots will significantly reduce the burden on election officials and creating bipartisan panels to conduct duplication will promote elector confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(15) Electors voting out of precinct add to the burden on election officials and lines for other electors because of the length of time it takes to process a 
provisional ballot in a precinct. Electors should be directed to the correct precinct on election day to ensure that they are able to vote in all elections for which they are eligible;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(16) In considering the changes in 2021, the General Assembly heard hours of testimony from electors, election officials, and attorneys involved in voting. Th
e General Assembly made significant modifications through the legislative process as it weighed the various interests involved, including adding further weekend voting, changing parameters for out-of-precinct voting, and adding transparency for ballot im

\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(1) Following the 2018 and 2020 elections, there was a significant lack of confidence in Georgia election systems, with many electors concerned about allegati
ons of rampant voter suppression and many electors concerned about allegations of rampant voter fraud;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(2) Many Georgia election processes were challenged in court, including the subjective signature-matching requirements, by Georgians on all sides of the polit
ical spectrum before and after the 2020 general election;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(3) The stress of the 2020 elections, with a dramatic increase in absentee-by-mail ballots and pandemic restrictions, demonstrated where there were opportunit
ies to update existing processes to reduce the burden on election officials and boost voter confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(4) The changes made in this legislation in 2021 are designed to address the lack of elector confidence in the election system on all sides of the political s
pectrum, to reduce the burden on election officials, and to streamline the process of conducting elections in Georgia by promoting uniformity in voting. Several examples will help explain how these goals are achieved;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(5) The broad discretion allowed to local officials for advance voting dates and hours led to significant variations across the state in total number of hours
 of advance voting, depending on the county. More than 100 counties have never offered voting on Sunday and many counties offered only a single day of weekend voting. Requiring two Saturday voting days and two optional Sunday voting days will dramaticall
y increase the total voting hours for voters across the State of Georgia, and all electors in Georgia will have access to multiple opportunities to vote in person on the weekend for the first time;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(6) Some counties in 2020 received significant infusions of grant funding for election operations, while other counties received no such funds. Promoting unif
ormity in the distribution of funds to election operations will boost voter confidence and ensure that there is no political advantage conferred by preferring certain counties over others in the distribution of funds;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(7) Elections in Georgia are administered by counties, but that can lead to problems for voters in counties with dysfunctional election systems. Counties with
 long-term problems of lines, problems with processing of absentee ballots, and other challenges in administration need accountability, but state officials are limited in what they are able to do to address those problems. Ensuring there is a mechanism t
o address local election problems will promote voter confidence and meet the goal of uniformity;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(8) Elections are a public process and public participation is encouraged by all involved, but the enthusiasm of some outside groups in sending multiple absen
tee ballot applications in 2020, often with incorrectly filled-in voter information, led to significant confusion by electors. Clarifying the rules regarding absentee ballot applications will build elector confidence while not sacrificing the opportuniti
es for electors to participate in the process;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(9) The lengthy absentee ballot process also led to elector confusion, including electors who were told they had already voted when they arrived to vote in pe
rson. Creating a definite period of absentee voting will assist electors in understanding the election process while also ensuring that opportunities to vote are not diminished, especially when many absentee ballots issued in the last few days before the
 election were not successfully voted or were returned late;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(10) Opportunities for delivering absentee ballots to a drop box were first created by the State Election Board as a pandemic response. The drop boxes created
 by rule no longer existed in Georgia law when the emergency rules that created them expired. The General Assembly considered a variety of options and constructed a system that allows the use of drop boxes, while also ensuring the security of the system 
and providing options in emergency situations;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(11) The lengthy nine-week runoffs in 2020 were exhausting for candidates, donors, and electors. By adding ranked choice voting for military and overseas vote
rs, the run-off period can be shortened to a more manageable period for all involved, easing the burden on election officials and on electors;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(12) Counting absentee ballots in 2020 took an incredibly long time in some counties. Creating processes for early processing and scanning of absentee ballots
 will promote elector confidence by ensuring that results are reported quickly;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(13) The sanctity of the precinct was also brought into sharp focus in 2020, with many groups approaching electors while they waited in line. Protecting elect
ors from improper interference, political pressure, or intimidation while waiting in line to vote is of paramount importance to protecting the election system and ensuring elector confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(14) Ballot duplication for provisional ballots and other purposes places a heavy burden on election officials. The number of duplicated ballots has continued
 to rise dramatically from 2016 through 2020. Reducing the number of duplicated ballots will significantly reduce the burden on election officials and creating bipartisan panels to conduct duplication will promote elector confidence;
\par }\pard \s44 {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f1\fs20\cf0\nosupersub  \'93(15) Electors voting out of precinct add to the burden on election officials and lines for other electors because of the length of time it takes to process a 
provisional ballot in a precinct. Electors should be directed to the correct precinct on election day to ensure that they are able to vote in all elections for which they are eligible;

constitutional offices; state offices; district attorneys; members of the Georgia House of Representatives and Georgia Senate; all constitutional judicial officers; and all county and municipal elected officials, to institute and establish a requirement 
of public disclosure of campaign contributions and expenditures relative to the seeking of such offices, to the recall of public officers holding elective office, and to the influencing of voter approval or rejection of a proposed constitutional amendmen
t, a state-wide referendum, or a proposed question which is to appear on the ballot in any county or municipal election. Further, it is the policy of this state that the state\'92s public affairs will be best served by disclosures of significant private 
interests of public officers and officials which may influence the discharge of their public duties and responsibilities. The General Assembly further finds that it is for the public to determine whether significant private interests of public officers h
ave influenced the state\'92s public officers to the detriment of their public duties and responsibilities and, in order to make that determination and hold the public officers accountable, the public must have reasonable access to the disclosure of the 
significant private interests of the public officers of this state.
